TheFourierTransformAndItsApplications-
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
We＊re on the air. Okay.
 A few quick announcements.
all,
 the second problem set is posted on the website.
 Actually,
 I posted it last evening.
for those of you that are very eager and check on the website all the time,
 it was there.
And secondly,
 the TAs are beginning their office hours this week,
right?Okay,
 so if you have any questions for them,
 they will be available to help.
 All right,
anything on anybody＊s mind,
 any questions about anything?
Student:
Um.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Yeah.
Student:
[Inaudible].
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Anybody else have any issues with the online lectures?
don＊t know,
 I haven＊t 每 I'm afraid to look at myself,
 so I don＊t know what they＊re like.
Student:
I was [Inaudible].
Student:
Nothing happens.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Nothing happens when you click on it?
Student:
[Inaudible].
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
It＊s a little trick we like to play on people.
Student:
[Inaudible] which browser you are using,
 so in the Mac [inaudible],
[inaudible].
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
So the question may be which browser you＊re using.
honestly don＊t know; I＊ve never tried to do it before [inaudible].
Student:
If you＊re using a Mac,
 you have to use Safari; it doesn＊t work on anything else.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
It doesn＊t work on anything else,
 except 每 use the Mac,
word from over there is you have to use Safari,
 which is the one that comes with it.
don＊t know about other ones.
 Anybody else have issues with this?
post an announcement,
 I suppose.
But I haven＊t heard,
 actually I haven＊t tried it,
look,
 the lectures?
Student:
[Inaudible].
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Great.
 Thank you; that was the right answer.
 Anything else?
All right,
 so I＊ll check into it,
 but try that on the Mac,
 try Safari or try other browsers.
Any problem with PCs?
Student:
They work fine.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
PCs work fine; okay.
 Don＊t, don＊t 每 I don＊t want to see.
right,
 anything else?
 All right,
 so today I have two things in mind today.
up our discussion of some of the theoretical aspects of Fourier series.
the surface on this a little bit,
 and it really,
 you know,
wonderful material and it really is important in its own way.
But as I＊ve said before and now you＊ll hear me say again,
diverse that sometimes you just have to,
topic,
 you could easily spend most of the quarter on it and it would be worthwhile,
that would mean we wouldn＊t do other things which are equally worthwhile.
And so it＊s always a constant trade-
off.
 It＊s always a question of which choices to make.
So again,
 there are more details in the notes than I＊ve been able to do in class,
able to do in class,
 but I do want to say a few more things about it today.
thing.
important application historically,
we will be talking about quite a bit as the course progresses.
 All right,
and again,
 some of the sort of the theoretical size of things.
And I＊ll remind what the issue is that we＊re studying,
fine, all right?
infinite sums,
 infinite Fourier series,
by no means the exception,
 all right?
Minus Infinity,
 Infinity, cK, either the 2 pi, KT.
coefficients,
 but the problem is general.
 How do you make sense of such an infinite sum?
And the tricky thing about it is that if you think in terms of sines and cosines,
functions are oscillating.
All right,
 everything here in sight is a complex number and complex functions,
in terms of the real functions,
and negative,
 so for this thing to converge,
cancellations that making it work.
Of course,
study issues of convergents.
around from positive to negative,
 see,
 all right and that makes it trickier to do.
makes it trickier to study.
And again,
 realize that this is by no means the exception,
again is periodic,
 period 1,
Fourier series.
We want to write with some confidence,
about,
 that F of T,
 say is equal to its Fourier series going from minus [inaudible] 2 p i KT,
and again,
 it＊s really if you want to deal with any degree of generality,
of terms.
A finite number of terms,
 a finite of trigometric sum will be infinitely smooth.
function and all its derivatives will be infinitely differentiatable,
discontinuity in any derivative you can＊t have a finite sum.
So any lack of smoothness forces an infinite sum,
 again,
trumpeted as being so general,
infinite number of terms here,
 all right?
Now, by the way,
 I don＊t mean to say that all the terms are necessarily non-
zero,the coefficients are necessarily non-zero.
 That＊s not true.
 Some of the terms may be zero.
For example,
 when you have certain symmetries,
odd coefficients may be zero and in special cases,
block of them may be zero.
 You don＊t know exactly what＊s gonna happen.
smoothness in there.
 All right, so again,
 that＊s the issue. Yeah.
Student:
[Inaudible].
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Does [inaudible] of K,
like a T,
 it＊s [inaudible].
 All right,
 the K Fourier coefficient.
definition is since we＊re gonna use that.
 So [inaudible] of K is the integral as a K,
from 0 to 1 of either the minus 2 pi KT, F of T DT.
 Is somebody＊s phone ringing?
All right,
 now, so last time we dealt with,
 at least in statement,
want.
 All right,
 so F of T is continuous,
 smooth or even if you have a jump continuity,
then you get the sort of kind of convergents that you want.
convergents.
I＊ll just leave it at that because the precise statement we talked about last time,
also in the notes,
 you get satisfactory convergents results.
 So that＊s fine, so again,
gives you a certain amount of confidence that you write the series down,
manipulate it and plug into it and things like that and nothing terrible is gonna happen.
But to deal with a more general functions,
 the more general signals that arise,
requires a different point of view,
 all right,
view,
 and that＊s where we finished up last time.
Now,
 it＊s not just for fun,
 even for mathematical fun.
 That is,
to have far-
discussion,
 not only for Fourier series,
sort of everyday use in a lot of fields of signal processing.
So very generality requires a different point of view,
 different terminology,
language and a whole sort of re-
orientation.
 All right,
 and again,
 I set that up last time,
aspect of it today and that＊s all we＊re gonna do,
 sad to say,
 all right?
So again,
 the condition is the integrability of all things.
 Instead of smoothness,
differentiability,
 the condition that turns out to be important is integrability to function.
All right,
 the important condition,
 and a relatively easy one to verify,
 integrability,right?
So you say that a function,
 say that F of T is squared integrable or briefly,
is in L2 of the integral from 0 to 1.
 I'm only working on an integral from 0 to 1 here.
L2 stands for square,
 well the 2 stands for square and the L stands for Lebeg,
a little bit more about that in a second if the integral is finite,
finite,
I want to allow complex value functions here,
 although many of the applications are real,
but I want to allow complex value functions,
there, all right?
That＊s an easy condition to satisfy.
energy.
 That＊s another way of saying it,
 and you see that terminology.
All right?
 So if you have a periodic function,
 which is integrable,
 like so, all right,
again if F of T is periodic and square integrable,
coefficients exist.
Then your form,
 [inaudible],
 as before,
 either the minus 2 pi I,
convergents.
And you have,
 and this is the fundamental result,
difference between the function and the finite approximation between the function,
square of the difference,
 the integral of the square of the difference,
tends to infinity.
 Takes up the entire board and it deserves to.
 All right,
result, okay?Okay,
 now I really feel like have to say a little bit more here,
 but only a little bit more.
your point of view towards convergents,
 but you also have to generalize the integral.
All right,
generalization of the [Inaudible] integral.
 Do you have to worry about this?
 No. All right.
But the fact is,
 you only get these convergence results,
 such convergence results.
only really prove them in the slightly more general context of integration.
Convergence results,
 if you use a generalization of the integral even,
other subject due to Lebeg,
 and that＊s what the L stands for in L2,
 due to Lebeg.
French mathematician in the turn of the 20th Century,
these sorts of applications,
 trying to extend integration,
classically,
 mathematicians were worried about this,
the integral.
And with that more general,
 more flexible definition of the integral,
processes are easier to handle.
 You can do more than you＊d like to do,
don＊t feel justified in doing,
 and in that context,
about, all right.
 But he generalized the integral only,
 and by doing so,
suited to solving these sorts of problems.
It was really a quite compelling case.
 It was really a beautiful theory,
 but, you know,
a famous quote.
Calculus is called the [inaudible] integral.
 All right,
application,
 but there are more general integrals.
On the other hand,saying,
function as a remount integral or a Lebeg integrable.
 That＊s not the point.
All right,
 the point really is a theoretical one,
 not a practical one.
 But nevertheless,
somehow honesty compels me to say what＊s involved here.
 All right,
that you had to talk about convergents,
 and it＊s not an unreasonable condition,
 all right,
that is also called,
 as I said last time,
 convergents in energy,
mean squared convergents.
approximation,
 square that,
then that tends to zero as [inaudible] infinity.
instead of approximating it at a single point.
 And again, you will,
literature and I'm talking about the engineering literature,
time.
 You＊ll see L2 all the time.
As a matter of fact, actually,
 if you take,mechanics,
 not that I ever have,
 but if you do,
of L2 [inaudible] spaces and things like that,
 [inaudible] spaces and L2 spaces and so on.
It＊s not,
 I'm not making this up.
of the discussion.
in applying mathematical formulas,
them in and this is for many problems,
 exactly that.
Now, there is one further aspect of it,
 and that＊s as far as I'm gonna go,
coefficients.
 So I want to highlight that now.
So remember in solving for the Fourier coefficients way back when,
time and I wanted to bring it back now in a more general context again,
Fourier coefficients we used a simple integration fact that it was actually everything.
was essential that either the 2 pi,
can combine those complex exponentials,
to zero if M is different from N.
 If M is equal to N,
 then it＊s equal to 1,
 all right?
That simple fact,
into those spaces.
 So this simple observation,
 simple fact,
introducing,
 if I can say it that way,
 introducing ※Geometry,
it＊s geometry like you don＊t even think of geometry,
analogy.
Geometry into the space into square integral functions,
 L2 01.
geometry, again I'm reasoning by analogy here,
 although it＊s a very powerful analogy.
And the thing that makes geometry,
of no perpendicularity.
All right,
gets carried over here.
 It allows you,
perpendicularity,
 same word, same thing, all right,
 via inner product or dot product.
All right,
 so let me give you the definition.
justification in the book actually,
 in the notes.
 But it looks like this,
are square integrable functions and I'm gonna assume they＊re complex,
case,
 square integrable on 01,
 as always,
 that＊s the basic assumption we make.
for vectors a generalization of the dot product for vectors,
 by an integral formula,
right,
 it＊s defined by FG and you＊re right,
 there are various notations for it,
common notation is just to put them in a pair,
angled brackets or sometimes people do all sorts of things.
Sometimes physicists call it,
 you know,
all sorts of bizarre,
 unnatural things.
 But I＊ll take the simplest notation,
 so zero to one,
of T times G of T bar complex conjugate DT.
value of functions.
If G of T were a real value of function,
notes.
 You put the complex conjugate in there.
Now,
generalization of the [inaudible] of two vectors.
vectors?
 You multiply the components together,
and add,
 all right?
So it＊s like you＊re multiplying the values together,
conjugate of the other function,
 those are the values,
 and you＊re adding,
in the sense of taking the integral instead of the sum,
 all right?
comes from.
Now, that＊s fine,
 but the real benefit is it allows you to define if you ever want to do that,
when two vectors,
 when two functions are perpendicular.
orthogonal,
 you could say they＊re perpendicular,
if you say they＊re orthogonal,
 all right.
Orthogonal and if you write it neatly 每 orthogonal,
 much neater.
 If they＊re in a product,it＊s 0,
 if FG is equal to 0 period 每 that＊s a definition,
 all right.
 That＊s a definition.
 Now,where does the definition come from,
 again, you know,
much as I＊d like to,
 let me refer to the notes,
 because it＊s actually not so unreasonable.
inner products.
Now,complex exponentials are orthogonal.
 One more thing actually,
length of a function or the norm of a function in terms of the inner product,
the integral,
 same thing.
So the norm of F,
 norm of a function F,
inner product of the function of itself,
inner product of a vector with itself.
squared and that＊s the notation you use,
of F squared is exactly the integral from 0 to 1 of F of T squared DT.
And let me just tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is then.
 All right,
theorem is 每 I＊ll do it over here,
 because that＊s where this comes from.
where this definition comes from and that＊s exactly where the property comes from.
Pythagorean theorem is exactly this,
and only if the inner product is 0.
Why is that the Pythagorean theorem 每 because of vector addition,
 all right?
vectors, U and V,
 then this is the vector U plus V,
 all right,
Pythagorean theorem says,
sides for right triangle and only for right triangle.
§ That characterizes the right triangle,
all right.
So that says the norm of U plus V squared,
the sum of the squares of the other two sides,
 U squared plus V squared,
inner product comes from and everything else.
Beautiful 每 it＊s beautiful,
 all right.
 So the trick is in extending that from,
sort of thing,
analogy, all right. 
It＊s not, you know,
what you shouldn＊t think about,
 the analogy is very strong.
this more general situation; however,
 so let me say one more thing then.
These complex exponentials are exactly functions or orthogonal functions of length one.
That calculation that I＊ve just erased with complex exponentials says this,
2 pi NT in a product with either 2 pi MT,
 all right,
conjugate of this.
 The conjugate of either the 2 p MT is either the minus 2 pi MT,
where the minus sign comes from,
 all right.
This is equal to zero if M is different from N and it＊s different to one if M is equal to N.
All right,
 these are ortho-
normal vectors with respect to this inner product.
orthogonal,
 their inner product is zero,
 when they＊re distinct,
 and they have Length One,
their norm is equal to 1 when they＊re equal.
Okay, now,
 as I said your reason by analogy,
to be perpendicular.
 You can draw this picture,
 all right.
 So you might say to yourself,
should be able to visualize this.
 I should be able to sit in a quite room,
and visualize what it means for complex exponentials to be orthogonal.
 Yes, yes, I see it.
No, you don＊t.
 Let me relieve you of this burden.
should be able to visualize when two functions,
orthogonal.
of a person if you cannot visualize when two functions are perpendicular,
complex exponentials,
 but sines and cosines,
 all sort of innocent-
orthogonality relationship.
But you might say to yourself,
 like sines and cosines,
FT or sine of 2 p T is orthogonal to cosine 2 p T.
 All sorts of interesting results like that,
but you might say to yourself,
 ※Gee if I look at the graph,
this.
§ Don＊t bother.All right,
 there＊s no point.
 There＊s no point.
 It＊s reasoning by analogy, all right.
intuition for orthogonal functions,
situations where you can＊t visualize it,
reasoning,
business applying somehow,
 all right.
All right,
 now, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost,
 the final thing then,
the function on to these complex exponentials,
 all right.
 So again,
one of the ways you use inner product is to define projections,
projections in particular,
projections.
All right,
 if U and V are two vectors,
 univectors, say,
equals 1,
 then what is the projection of V onto U,
the inner product of V.
U.
 That＊s how much U knows V or V knows U,
 all right.
projection here is the inner product of V with U,
 okay.
the inner product of U,
 same thing.
All right,
 so the vector projection here is that＊s the length of the projection,
 all right,
then the vector that goes in the direction of U that has this length is this time,
vector projection is inner product of V with U times U.
All right,
 U is the univector,
project,
 and it＊ shouldn＊t be shocking.
its projections onto given vectors can be a very useful thing.
It＊s breaking a vector down into its component parts,
component parts,
 all right. Now,
 what is the situation for functions,
analogous.
 I don＊t want to say it＊s exactly the same because you can＊t draw the picture,
but you can write down the formulas and the formulas are a good guide.
a good guide.
What is the Fourier coefficient?
 The Fourier coefficient is exactly a projection,
 all right.
If I compute the inner product of the function F with the complex exponential,
2pi NT,bar DT.
 That is the integral from zero to one of F of T either the minus 2 pi NT DT,
is the nth Fourier coefficient.
function onto the nth complex exponential.
All right,
 cool. Way cool.
 Infinitely cool. So cool.
 And what is writing the Fourier series?
minus infinity to infinity,
exponential times the complex K complex exponential.
This is a number,
 all right,
 that＊s the Fourier coefficient.
projection of F onto its K component,
 and there＊s the K component.
 All right,what that is,
 and it＊s this point of view that is so ubiquitous,
 all right, so ubiquitous,
only in a Fourier series,
 but in other versions of essentially the same ideas.
And you see this all the time in signal processing.
 I talk about wavelets time.
wavelets just very briefly because wavelets is such a hot topic.
 It＊s the same sort of thing.
simpler components are either the 2 p or the complex exponentials,
 all right.
form an ortho-
normal basis for the square integrable functions,
 all right.
and all the rest of that jazz is to say,
 is to say,
these, even the 2 pi KT,
 K going from minus infinity to infinity form an ortho-
basis for these periodic functions,
 squared integral periodic functions,
 all right.
And then sometimes the game is to take different ortho-
normal basis.
nothing but,
 I'm not going to say nothing but because they have their own fascination,
they＊re another ortho-
normal basis for square integrable functions.
The complex exponentials are not the only ortho-
just doesn＊t＊ have,
 has lots of different orthogonal-
normal basis.useful ones.
So to write this synthesis formula is to express F in terms of its components,
components,
 the components in terms of these elementary building blocks,
 all right,
what are the coefficients,
 the coefficients,
 like they are for any ortho-
projection of the vector in those directions,
 all right.
It＊s very satisfying and you should try to put this in your head,
 yeah.
Student:
[inaudible].
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Well,
 it＊s more complicated,
a rotation of unitary or orthogonal matrix and in space,
 yes,
transformations linear operators that are unitary,
complicated.
But you have similar sets of things.
 All right,
 you can get to ortho-
ortho-normal basis.
 Okay. All right,
 this is,
 like I say,
 so what one can say,
 of course,
would say much more about this.
 I don＊t want to.
 All right,
 well, I do want to,
 but I can＊t,all right.
All right,
 it＊s this point of view that is important for you to carry forward,
 all right.
all I'm saying because you will see it,
 you will see it,
 all right.
 And again,
reason by analogy,
 all right.
 You gotta; it＊s hard to write down this formula,
 all right,
that＊s something new.
 All right,
 writing down a formula,
in terms of an integral,
 all right,
 I gotta deal with that.
 That＊s something hard,
visualize it,
 all right.
the words you use in the situation where you can＊t visualize things.
 All right,
and I＊ll give you one,
 I keep saying one final thing.
So this time for sure,
 an application of this is what＊s also called Railey＊s identity,
sum of the squares of its components,
 all right.
You know how to find the length of a vector in [inaudible].
components,
 right? You do the same thing here.
 Railey＊s identity,
for you,
 but it is derived in the book and I even say something like,
derivation.
It says the integral from 0 to 1 of F of T squared DT.
coefficients 每 I didn＊t write that down,
coefficients.
 Okay,
 going from minus infinity to infinity of [inaudible] K squared,
right. That＊s Railey＊s identify.
It says the length of a vector is the sum of the squares of its components,
 all right,
components of the function are its Fourier coefficients,
 all right.
function; it is the inner product of the square length of a function.
a function with itself.
 It is the sum of the squares of its components.
 That＊s all this says.
products for vectors,
 exactly, exactly.All right,
 now, this was known before any of this stuff was put in place,
 all right,
when all this sort of general framework was put in place,
the general framework or orthogonal functions,
 square integrable functions,
that jazz,
 and it was viewed as an identity for energy,
 all right,
 this is the energy,
function and these are somehow,
 you know,
 the individual components here.
And that＊s why one often says,
frequency domain,
 we＊re gonna find an analogy for this before it transforms,
 all right.
But it really says nothing other than the length of the vectors,
the components.
How much 每 so let me write down,
 here＊s F of T is the sum of,
 here＊s the Fourier series,
[inaudible] either the 2 pi KT,
 all right.
 All right,
signal?
 It has this much.
 All right,
have?Well,one.
 So, how much energy,have?
 It＊s the magnitude of this thing squared; it＊s the multiplier.
front.
[Inaudible] squared times the energy,
 which is 1 of the complex exponential,
the total energy here,
 what is the square of the total energy here?
squares or the contributions of that energy from individual components.
component is contributing an amount [inaudible] of K to the whole sum,
contributes is the square of [Inaudible] of K absolute value squared to the whole sum,
whole number, okay,
 pretty cool; pretty cool.
All right,
 here ends the sermon.
plate. All right. All right,
on, okay?
 All I can say is trust me; you＊ll run into it again.
Now, I want to do and I probably won＊t finish it today.
 I＊ll finish it up on Wednesday,
although it goes pretty fast.
of the classic physical problem,
 in fact,
 the problem that launched the whole subject.
I want to do an application to heat flow.
All right,
 this is a very important part of your intellectual heritage,
 all right.
 I'm serious.
That is if you＊re going to be practicing scientists and engineers,
 you know,
know something about where the subject came from because again,
 you know,
how wind up re-
visiting a lot of these ideas in different context,
context.
And this was the problem that really started it all.
heat, how the temperature varies in time,
distribution.
All right,
initial distribution F of X of temperature.
sort of spatial variable,
 all right,
 so some region in space, you know,
is the dimension of the region,
 all right.[inaudible], all right.
You have an initial distribution of temperature,
 that＊s what happens at T equals zero,
as T increases,
 the temperature changes.
 All right,
body to the other part of the body and you want to know how is that governed,
 all right.
How does the temperature change both in position,
 I should say vary,
 well,
每 how does the temperature change in position and time.
 All right,
problem,
special case of it,
 the case of the original case that was handled by Fourier series,
problem with the Fourier study.
Where periodicity comes into the problem naturally because of the periodicity in space.
So to study this problem means to say first of all,
distribution of temperature,
 all right.
So we look at a heated ring.
 Sound 每 that sound.
 Okay. All right,
 something like this,right.
 Given an initial temperature,
 given an initial temperature say F of X,
a position on the circle; X is a point on the circle,
 okay?
temperature at X at time T 每 at position X at time T.
 All right,say something about it.
 That＊s the function we want to find.
We want to study U of XT,
 all right.
 Now, the fact is periodicity enters into this problem,
periodicity in space because the circle,
temperature at the same place,
 if I increase it by 2 p if I'm going around a circle,
obviously the temperature is periodic as the position.
Okay,
 so the temperature is periodic as a function of X.
 All right,
things so we assume the period is 1,
 so the circle is radius or whatever it is,
end points, all right.
functions of Period 1,
 let＊s suppose that.
 Let＊s supposed Period 1.
Period 1, all right,
 so that is the function of the initial temperature distribution,
periodic of Period 1 and so is UNX,
 not in T; it＊s not periodic as a function of time,
it＊s periodic as a function of the spatial variable.
same thing as U of X at that value of T,
 okay?ideas.
 You＊d consider this problem where there＊s periodicity in space.
the object that you＊re heating up and that has consequences.
 All right,
 so now,
certain amount of confidence,
 with a certain amount of bravado,
Fourier series.
So we write the Fourier series,
infinity of C sub K,
 I＊ll write it like this,
 C sub K either the 2 pi KX.
spatial variable,
 so the variable in the complex exponential is X.
dependents?
 No,
 the time dependents is in the coefficient,
 C.
dependence has to be.
 K is just a constant; K is just an integer.
The time dependence is in the cK.
it is like so.
of T.
 I know what it is; it＊s the Fourier coefficient,
 I＊ll bring that in later,
write in terms,
 let me just call it C right now.
C sub K of T times E to the 2 pi KX,
 all right,
 periodic and X varying in T.
vary in T; that＊s what we want to know,
 all right.
 The mystery here are the coefficients.
We could solve the problem if I could find the coefficients,
temperature distribution,
 so what are the CK?
 That＊s the question.
All right, now,periodicity,
 independent of anything else,equation.
 All right,
 the flow of heat on a circle or another regions 每 all right,
itself a big subject,
 but it＊s one of the basic equations,
mathematical physics,
 which you have probably seen somewhere in your life and again,
you will see again,
 heat flow 每 I＊ll just do it in one dimension,
 all right.
I'm talking about one-
dimensional problems here,
this for flow over a two-
dimensional or a three-
dimensional region.
equation,
somehow maybe I should call it another constant because I＊ve already used K,
the second X derivative,
 all right.
 That＊s the one-dimensional heal equation.
All right,
 I'm not gonna derive that.
sort of follows Bracewell＊s discussion of the heat equation,
equation of mathematical physics.
this is one of these great dodges of all time.
to talk much about,
 but that affects the size of A,
 all right.
 I should say more generally,
this equation governs not just the flow of heat,
equation.
It governs how things diffuse.
 Things 每 what things,
by this equation,
 holes through a semi conductor are governed by an equation,
dimensional version of the equation but the same idea,
 all right,governs,
associated with diffusion.
It＊s a general term,
 but it＊s a term you＊ll probably run across.
 All right,
choose; I'm not gonna get too far today,
 but I'm gonna get a little along the way,
wanna choose 每 I want to apply this equation to study this function.
 All right,use this for the ring.
 All right, and just to simplify my calculation,
make any substantive difference,
 I'm gonna choose the constants so that A is equal to ..
That＊s a standard choice,
 certainly for the mathematical analysis,
 but it doesn＊t matter.
analysis.
 So I'm gonna choose A equals .
 or choose constants of A equals ..
equation looks like use of T is equal to .
 use of XX,
 all right.Now,
 I'm gonna short-
cut the discussion a little bit.
book, in the notes,
both can be justified very easily.
 I'm going to plug that equation,
have a formula for U in some sense,
 not in some sense,sense.
And I'm gonna plug this into the equation.
 Plug U of XT is sum over K, CK of T,
the 2 pi KX into the equation,
 into the use of T is equal to .
 UXX. What happens?
What happens? Well,
 so use of T,
 if I differentiate with respect,
said this,
 but I assumed everybody knew,T,
 or that function over there,
 so what is that? Well,
is the coefficients,
 C sub K.
 So that is sum over K,
exponential.
 That stays alone -
-
 2 pi KX.
 What is UXX of this expression?
Well,
 here I＊ve put the derivatives on the complex exponential and I differentiate twice,
differentiating complex exponential is like differentiating an ordinary exponential.
constant here comes down if I differentiate,
 so I get CK of T,
differentiating with respect to X and then if I differentiate the 2 pi KX twice,
to X,
 I get 2 pi K squared times either the 2 pi KX.
Nothing up my sleeve,
 no tricks,
 no deceptions.
 Okay, that＊s one more step,
complex exponential either the 2 pi KX.
 All right, not quite the two.
Then we gotta go 每 damn.
 Equate the two sides,
 use the heat equation.
equation. So I get sum plug into UTs is equal to .
 UXX,prime of T,
 either the 2 pi KX is equal .
 times that thing,
minus 2 p squared K squared times C 2 p squared K squared times CK of T,
complex exponential,
 either the 2 pi KX.
 Not hard, that＊s not a hard step.
Okay, all right,
 how would we do?
 Equate like terms; equate the coefficients.
the coefficients,
 something great happens.
 [Inaudible] consequences I＊ll do next time.
equate the coefficients,
 I＊ll get CK prime of T is equal to the coefficient,
equate the coefficients,
 I mean the coefficients of the complex exponential.
into the 2 p KX,
 what＊s the corresponding coefficient over here.
2 pi squared K squared,
 CK of T.
But my friends,
 you know,
 that is a simple equation.
equation for CK.
 I can solve this other problem.
 I get CK of T is the CK of 0,
condition times [inaudible] minus 2 p squared,
 K squared T. Blow me down,
 all right.
I＊ve found my coefficients 每 pretty cool.
 All right, extremely cool.
 Very cool.
absolutely magical happens.
 Wait for it on Wednesday.
 Okay.
