%FWTCOMPARE Compare wavedec2 and wavefast.
%   [RATIO, MAXDIFF] = FWTCOMPARE(F, N, WNAME) compares the operation
%   of toolbox function WAVEDEC2 and custom function WAVEFAST. 
%
%   INPUTS:
%     F           Image to be transformed.
%     N           Number of scales to compute.
%     WNAME       Wavelet to use.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%     RATIO       Execution time ratio (custom/toolbox)
%     MAXDIFF     Maximum coefficient difference.
