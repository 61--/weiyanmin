function  c = fchcode(b, conn, dir)
%FCHCODE Computes the Freeman chain code of a boundary.
%   C = FCHCODE(B) computes the 8-connected Freeman chain code of a
%   set of 2-D coordinate pairs contained in B, an np-by-2 array. C
%   is a structure with the following fields: 
%
%     c.fcc    = Freeman chain code (1-by-np)
%     c.diff   = First difference of code c.fcc (1-by-np)
%     c.mm     = Integer of minimum magnitude from c.fcc (1-by-np)
%     c.diffmm = First difference of code c.mm (1-by-np)
%     c.x0y0   = Coordinates where the code starts (1-by-2) 
%
%   C = FCHCODE(B, CONN) produces the same outputs as above, but
%   with the code connectivity specified in CONN. CONN can be 8 for
%   an 8-connected chain code, or CONN can be 4 for a 4-connected
%   chain code. Specifying CONN=4 is valid only if the input
%   sequence, B, contains transitions with values 0, 2, 4, and 6,
%   exclusively.
%       
%   C = FHCODE(B, CONN, DIR) produces the same outputs as above, but,
%   in addition, the desired code direction is specified. Values for
%   DIR can be: 
%
%     'same'      Same as the order of the sequence of points in b.
%                 This is the default.
%
%     'reverse'   Outputs the code in the direction opposite to the 
%                 direction of the points in B.  The starting point 
%                 for each DIR is the same.
%
%   The elements of B are assumed to correspond to a 1-pixel-thick,
%   fully-connected, closed boundary. B cannot contain duplicate
%   coordinate pairs, except in the first and last positions, which
%   is a common feature of boundary tracing programs. 
%
%   FREEMAN CHAIN CODE REPRESENTATION
%   The table on the left shows the 8-connected Freeman chain codes 
%   corresponding to allowed deltax, deltay pairs. An 8-chain is
%   converted to a 4-chain if (1) if conn = 4; and (2) only
%   transitions 0, 2, 4, and 6 occur in the 8-code.  Note that
%   dividing 0, 2, 4, and 6 by 2 produce the 4-code. 
%

%   The formula z = 4*(deltax + 2) + (deltay + 2) gives the following
%   sequence corresponding to rows 1-8 in the preceding table: z =
%   11,7,6,5,9,13,14,15. These values can be used as indices into the
%   table, improving the speed of computing the chain code. The
%   preceding formula is not unique, but it is based on the smallest
%   integers (4 and 2) that are powers of 2.
