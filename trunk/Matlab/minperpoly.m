function [x, y] = minperpoly(B, cellsize)
%MINPERPOLY Computes the minimum perimeter polygon.
%   [X, Y] = MINPERPOLY(F, CELLSIZE) computes the vertices in [X, Y]
%   of the minimum perimeter polygon of a single binary region or
%   boundary in image B. The procedure is based on Slansky's
%   shrinking rubber band approach. Parameter CELLSIZE determines the
%   size of the square cells that enclose the boundary of the region
%   in B. CELLSIZE must be a nonzero integer greater than 1.
%   
%   The algorithm is applicable only to boundaries that are not
%   self-intersecting and that do not have one-pixel-thick
%   protrusions.
