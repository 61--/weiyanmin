function [g, NR, SI, TI] = regiongrow(f, S, T)
%REGIONGROW Perform segmentation by region growing.
%   [G, NR, SI, TI] = REGIONGROW(F, SR, T).  S can be an array (the
%   same size as F) with a 1 at the coordinates of every seed point
%   and 0s elsewhere.  S can also be a single seed value. Similarly,
%   T can be an array (the same size as F) containing a threshold
%   value for each pixel in F. T can also be a scalar, in which
%   case it becomes a global threshold.   
%
%   On the output, G is the result of region growing, with each
%   region labeled by a different integer, NR is the number of
%   regions, SI is the final seed image used by the algorithm, and TI
%   is the image consisting of the pixels in F that satisfied the
%   threshold test.
