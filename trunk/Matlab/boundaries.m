function B = boundaries(BW, conn, dir)
%BOUNDARIES Trace object boundaries.  
%   B = BOUNDARIES(BW) traces the exterior boundaries of objects in
%   the binary image BW.  B is a P-by-1 cell array, where P is the
%   number of objects in the image. Each cell contains a Q-by-2
%   matrix, each row of which contains the row and column coordinates
%   of a boundary pixel.  Q is the number of boundary pixels for the
%   corresponding object.  Object boundaries are traced in the
%   clockwise direction.
%
%   B = BOUNDARIES(BW, CONN) specifies the connectivity to use when
%   tracing boundaries.  CONN may be either 8 or 4.  The default
%   value for CONN is 8.
%
%   B = BOUNDARIES(BW, CONN, DIR) specifies the direction used for
%   tracing boundaries.  DIR should be either 'cw' (trace boundaries
%   clockwise) or 'ccw' (trace boundaries counterclockwise).  If DIR
%   is omitted BOUNDARIES traces in the clockwise direction.
