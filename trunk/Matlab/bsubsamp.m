function [s, su] = bsubsamp(b, gridsep)
%BSUBSAMP Subsample a boundary.
%   [S, SU] = BSUBSAMP(B, GRIDSEP) subsamples the boundary B by
%   assigning each of its points to the grid node to which it is
%   closest.  The grid is specified by GRIDSEP, which is the
%   separation in pixels between the grid lines. For example, if
%   GRIDSEP = 2, there are two pixels in between grid lines. So, for
%   instance, the grid points in the first row would be at (1,1),
%   (1,4), (1,6), ..., and similarly in the y direction. The value
%   of GRIDSEP must be an even integer. The boundary is specified by
%   a set of coordinates in the form of an np-by-2 array.  It is
%   assumed that the boundary is one pixel thick. 
%
%   Output S is the subsampled boundary. Output SU is normalized so
%   that the grid separation is unity.  This is useful for obtaining
%   the Freeman chain code of the subsampled boundary.
