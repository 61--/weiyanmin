function [r, c, hnew] = houghpeaks(h, numpeaks, threshold, nhood)
%HOUGHPEAKS Detect peaks in Hough transform.
%   [R, C, HNEW] = HOUGHPEAKS(H, NUMPEAKS, THRESHOLD, NHOOD) detects
%   peaks in the Hough transform matrix H.  NUMPEAKS specifies the
%   maximum number of peak locations to look for.  Values of H below
%   THRESHOLD will not be considered to be peaks.  NHOOD is a
%   two-element vector specifying the size of the suppression
%   neighborhood.  This is the neighborhood around each peak that is
%   set to zero after the peak is identified.  The elements of NHOOD
%   must be positive, odd integers.  R and C are the row and column
%   coordinates of the identified peaks.  HNEW is the Hough transform
%   with peak neighborhood suppressed. 
%
%   If NHOOD is omitted, it defaults to the smallest odd values >=
%   size(H)/50.  If THRESHOLD is omitted, it defaults to
%   0.5*max(H(:)).  If NUMPEAKS is omitted, it defaults to 1.
