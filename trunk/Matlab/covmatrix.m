function [C, m] = covmatrix(X)
%COVMATRIX Computes the covariance matrix of a vector population.
%   [C, M] = COVMATRIX(X) computes the covariance matrix C and the
%   mean vector M of a vector population organized as the rows of
%   matrix X. C is of size N-by-N and M is of size N-by-1, where N is
%   the dimension of the vectors (the number of columns of X).
