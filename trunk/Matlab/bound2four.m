function rc_new = bound2four(rc)
%BOUND2FOUR Convert 8-connected boundary to 4-connected boundary.
%   RC_NEW = BOUND2FOUR(RC) converts an eight-connected boundary to a
%   four-connected boundary.  RC is a P-by-2 matrix, each row of
%   which contains the row and column coordinates of a boundary
%   pixel.  BOUND2FOUR inserts new boundary pixels wherever there is
%   a diagonal connection.
