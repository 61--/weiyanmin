function d = bayesgauss(X, CA, MA, P)
%BAYESGAUSS Bayes classifier for Gaussian patterns.
%   D = BAYESGAUSS(X, CA, MA, P) computes the Bayes decision
%   functions of the n-dimensional patterns in the rows of X. 
%   CA is an array of size n-by-n-by-W containing W covariance
%   matrices of size n-by-n, where W is the number of classes.
%   MA is an array of size n-by-W, whose columns are the corres-
%   ponding mean vectors. A cov. matrix and a mean vector must be 
%   specified for each class, even is some are equal.  X is of size 
%   K-by-n, where K is the number of patterns to be classified. P is 
%   a 1-by-W array, containing the probabilities of occurrence of 
%   each class.  If P is not included in the argument, the classes 
%   are assumed to be equally likely.  
%
%   D, is a column vector of length K. Its ith element is the class
%   number assigned to the ith vector in X during classification.
