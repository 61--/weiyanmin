function g = splitmerge(f, mindim, fun)
%SPLITMERGE Segment an image using a split-and-merge algorithm.
%   G = SPLITMERGE(F, MINDIM, @PREDICATE) segments image F by using a
%   split-and-merge approach based on quadtree decomposition. MINDIM
%   (a positive integer power of 2) specifies the minimum dimension
%   of the quadtree regions (subimages) allowed. If necessary, the
%   program pads the input image with zeros to the nearest square  
%   size that is an integer power of 2. This guarantees that the  
%   algorithm used in the quadtree decomposition will be able to 
%   split the image down to blocks of size 1-by-1. The result is  
%   cropped back to the original size of the input image. In the  
%   output, G, each connected region is labeled with a different
%   integer.
%
%   Note that in the function call we use @PREDICATE for the value of 
%   fun.  PREDICATE is a function in the MATLAB path, provided by the
%   user. Its syntax is
%
%       FLAG = PREDICATE(REGION) which must return TRUE if the pixels
%       in REGION satisfy the predicate defined by the code in the
%       function; otherwise, the value of FLAG must be FALSE.
% 
%   The following simple example of function PREDICATE is used in 
%   Example 10.9 of the book.  It sets FLAG to TRUE if the 
%   intensities of the pixels in REGION have a standard deviation  
%   that exceeds 10, and their mean intensity is between 0 and 125. 
%   Otherwise FLAG is set to false. 
%
%       function flag = predicate(region)
%       sd = std2(region);
%       m = mean2(region);
%       flag = (sd > 10) & (m > 0) & (m < 125);
