00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lecture01 Instructor (Brad Osgood):

3
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,017
We are on the air.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,583
Okay.

5
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,815
Welcome,

6
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:30,438
 one and all.

7
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:31,365
And as it said on the TV when you were walking in,

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:31,855
 but just to make sure everybody knows,

9
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,896
 this is EE261,

10
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:40,172
 The Fourier Transform and its Applications,

11
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:42,519
 Fourier Transforms et al.

12
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:42,841
,

13
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,964
 Fourier.

14
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:52,844
And my name is Brad Osgood.

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:52,770
Circulating around are two documents that give you information about the class.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,905
There's a general description of the class,

17
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:04,842
 course information,

18
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:05,676
 how we're gonna proceed,

19
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:08,408
 some basic bookkeeping items 

20
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:11,948
！ I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a second 

21
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,593
！ and also a syllabus and a schedule,

22
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:14,426
 and I will also say a little bit more about that in just a second.

23
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,633
Let me introduce our partners in crime in this course.

24
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,202
We have three course assistants,

25
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:17,843
 Thomas John 

26
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:22,557
！ Thomas,

27
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:23,706
 wanna stand up?

28
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:24,390
 Where's Thomas?

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,281
 There we go.

30
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:30,487
Rajiv Agarwal.

31
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:31,858
Did I spell that right?

32
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,234
 Very good.

33
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:33,681
Rajiv,

34
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,651
 you wanna stand up?

35
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:37,951
 There's Rajiv.

36
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:41,012
And Nicomedus 

37
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:41,559
！ okay so far?

38
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,833
 

39
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,486
！ M.

40
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:46,693
Wanna correct that?

41
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:47,902
 Okay.

42
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:51,962
That's Nicomedus,

43
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,316
 everybody.

44
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:53,746
Thank you.

45
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,832
All right.

46
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:59,007
And we will be setting up times for the review sessions and so on,

47
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:00,016
 all right?

48
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:01,595
 So that will be forthcoming.

49
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:03,327
We have a web page for the course.

50
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,011
Some of you may have already visited that,

51
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,323
 but let me give you the 

52
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:08,511
！ and the address is on one of the sheets that's being passed around,

53
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:13,148
 but let me write that up now so you can be sure to visit it 

54
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:17,401
and register for the class because it is on the web page that you will find course handouts,

55
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,676
 course information.

56
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:22,385
I will email people via the web page,

57
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,570
 all right?

58
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,652
 So you have to be registered.

59
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:28,801
If I have to send an announcement to the class,

60
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,247
 post an announcement and send out an email,

61
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:29,996
 then that'll be done through the web page,

62
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,864
 and you have to be registered on the web page in order to get those emails.

63
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,164
I won't be doing it through Axess,

64
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:34,686
 all right?

65
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:35,745
 So it is at,

66
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:37,861
 like many of the other E classes,

67
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,718
 http:

68
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:39,058
// 

69
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:39,461
！ however you do that,

70
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:43,864
 wherever the colons go 

71
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:44,509
！ where is it here?

72
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:44,946
 

73
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,136
！ eeclass.

74
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:46,656
stanford.

75
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,583
edu 

76
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,077
！ you can find it very easily 

77
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:50,855
！ edu/ee261,

78
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:56,030
 okay?

79
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,061
 Go there if you have not already and register yourself for the class.

80
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,413
All right.

81
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:03,052
Now,

82
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,713
 let me say a little bit about the information that you have.

83
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:07,153
I wanna say a little bit more about the mechanics.

84
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,821
I'll talk more about the content in just a second.

85
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:17,228
Let me say a little bit about the syllabus and schedule and the course reader.

86
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,676
The syllabus is,

87
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,669
 as I said on the top,

88
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,315
 an outline of what we're gonna be doing,

89
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,439
 I hope a fairly accurate outline of what we're going to be doing,

90
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,571
 but it's not a contract,

91
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:27,158
 all right?

92
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,385
 So there will be a natural ebb and flow of the course as things go along,

93
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:34,033
 and when we get to particular material or what we cover in what order,

94
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,694
 this is more or less I say accurate,

95
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,381
 but it is not written in stone.

96
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,060
What you should use it for,

97
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,476
 however,

98
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:42,887
 is to plan your reading,

99
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:50,541
 so things will be much better for all of us if you read along with the material as the syllabus 

100
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,986
！ as the schedule basically outlines,

101
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,250
 all right,

102
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,367
 because there are times when I'm gonna wanna skip around a little bit.

103
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,550
There are times when I'm gonna derive things.

104
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,506
There are times when I'm not gonna derive things.

105
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,867
And you'll get much more out of the lectures,

106
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,149
 our time together,

107
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,312
 if you've read the material thoroughly before you come to class.

108
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,583
So that's one thing I ask you to do.

109
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,823
We have two exams scheduled.

110
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,124
We have a midterm exam and a final exam.

111
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,477
I'm gonna skip to the midterm exam.

112
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,871
Midterm exam is already actually on there,

113
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,569
 at least tentatively,

114
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:18,996
 sort of toward the end of October.

115
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:21,406
We'll have it outside of class.

116
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:22,901
That is,

117
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,756
 it'll be a sit-

118
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:24,252
 down,

119
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,103
 regular exam,

120
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:27,461
 but I wanna do it for 90 minutes rather than 50 minutes.

121
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:31,864
Fifty minutes is just too short a time for material like this,

122
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:32,948
 so it'll be a 90-

123
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,339
minute exam,

124
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,105
 and we'll schedule it several sessions outside of class.

125
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:37,602
This is the way I've usually done it,

126
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:38,022
 and it hasn't been any problem.

127
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:40,497
It's worked out all right for everybody.

128
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:41,906
So we'll have alternate times and so on.

129
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,809
And the final exam is scheduled by the registrar's office.

130
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,378
Do not come to me right before the final exam saying,

131
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:48,707
 "Oh,

132
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:49,546
 I scheduled a trip out of town.

133
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,508
I hope that's not a problem,

134
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:51,744
" all right?

135
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,549
 You know what the dates are ahead of time.

136
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,988
We'll also have regular problem sets.

137
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:57,857
None of these things that I'm saying should be new to you.

138
00:04:57,857 --> 00:04:59,310
You've been through the drill many times.

139
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,403
The problem sets are gonna be 

140
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:05,239
！ I had a startling innovation last time I taught the course

141
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:09,452
 where I handed out the problem sets on Monday and had them due the following Wednesday.

142
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,405
So you actually had,

143
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:10,982
 like,

144
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,327
 a week and a half to do the problem sets,

145
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,308
 and there was overlap between the two.

146
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:16,215
And people thought that was just a brilliant idea.

147
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,651
So we're gonna do that again this year except for the first problem set,

148
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,613
 all right?

149
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:23,979
 I decided it was not such good policy to hand out the very first problem set on the very first day of class,

150
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,045
 so I'll hand that out on Wednesday and I'll post that also 

151
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:27,136
！ or at least I'll post it.

152
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,463
I'm not sure I'll hand it out.

153
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,117
It will be available on Wednesday,

154
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:30,890
 and it'll be due the following Wednesday.

155
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,139
And again,

156
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,639
 these sorts of things are pretty routine for you.

157
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,754
I'm sure you've been through them many times.

158
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:36,756
It will be practice,

159
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:41,710
 although again not necessarily every time without fail,

160
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,560
 to have MATLAB problems on the homework,

161
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,861
 one or two MATLAB problems on the homework.

162
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:50,590
So I'm going under the assumption that people have some experience with using MATLAB 

163
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,181
！ it doesn't have to be terribly advanced 

164
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:54,912
！ and also access to using MATLAB.

165
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:58,223
So if you do not have experience using MATLAB and you do not have access to MATLAB,

166
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,298
 get some experience and get some access.

167
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:04,413
Won't be hard.

168
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:04,945
Okay.

169
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:05,635
Now,

170
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:08,226
 let me say a little bit about some other things.

171
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:09,915
This is the course reader for the course.

172
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:15,427
It's available at the bookstore and also available on the course website,

173
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:16,305
 all right?

174
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,329
 It doesn't have the problems in it,

175
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,031
 but it has the material that we're gonna be covering in class.

176
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,080
Now,

177
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,567
 this is basically a stitched-

178
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,557
together set of lecture notes that I've been using for a number of years in the class,

179
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,675
 and I sort of tinker with it every time I teach the class.

180
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:30,949
But because it is a stitched-

181
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,182
together set of lecture notes,

182
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,519
 the organization is sometimes a little bit odd,

183
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,160
 like you have an appendix in the middle of the chapter.

184
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,301
And what that means is it used to be an appendix to a particular lecture that went on that particular day,

185
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,350
 and it never got moved to anywhere else,

186
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,256
 all right?

187
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,310
 So the organization can be a little bit funny.

188
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,828
You can help on this,

189
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:49,322
 all right?

190
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:50,098
 That is,

191
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:50,605
 if you find typos,

192
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:51,576
 if you find errors,

193
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,889
 if you find things that are less than clear in their wording,

194
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,894
 if you have some ideas for examples or other explanations,

195
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:00,212
 please tell me.

196
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,784
I am working on this.

197
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:06,270
I have to say that because these were written as a set of lecture notes,

198
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,097
 these are meant to be a good and I hope helpful companion for the class.

199
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:10,958
That is,

200
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,656
 they're meant to be read,

201
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,304
 and they're meant to be used.

202
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:14,769
So you can help,

203
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,704
 as generations of students in the past have helped,

204
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:22,382
 to try to refine these and turn them into something that's really a good accompaniment to the class as we go on,

205
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:23,399
 okay?

206
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,429
 One other thing that's special this quarter is the class is,

207
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,359
 as always,

208
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,347
 taped,

209
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:33,609
 and the lectures are gonna be available to everybody.

210
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:35,411
But this time for the first time,

211
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,145
 the lectures are gonna be available to the world,

212
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:38,626
 all right?

213
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,376
 Stanford has decided on an experimental basis 

214
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,489
！ we're sort of competing with MIT here,

215
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:44,292
 I think 

216
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:47,396
！ to try to make some of the materials for some classes available to the world,

217
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,176
 all right?

218
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:48,869
 So the lecture notes are gonna be 

219
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,865
！ everything's gonna be done through the website,

220
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:54,606
 but instead of needing a Stanford ID to view the taped lectures,

221
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:57,247
 I think anybody in the world can view these lectures.

222
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,684
It's a little bit daunting.

223
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:00,201
I have to watch my language,

224
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,818
 gotta dress well.

225
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:03,760
All right.

226
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,807
So we'll see what goes with that.

227
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:05,272
I will,

228
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:06,086
 however,

229
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,769
 issue a warning.

230
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,728
I will not answer the world's email,

231
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:10,695
 all right?

232
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:12,531
 I will answer email from the class,

233
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:13,579
 but I will not answer 

234
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,253
！ and I think I speak for the TAs here.

235
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:18,805
The TAs neither will answer the world's email on this,

236
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:19,641
 all right?

237
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,474
 How we're gonna keep the world out of our inboxes,

238
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:24,587
 I'm not sure exactly whether this is gonna be a problem or not,

239
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,881
 but at any rate,

240
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,920
 that's what's happening,

241
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,761
 okay?

242
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,529
 All right.

243
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,788
Any questions about that?

244
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,271
 Any questions about the mechanics of the course or what your expectations should be,

245
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,054
 what my expectations of you are?

246
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:40,442
 Okay.

247
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:40,868
All right.

248
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:41,395
Now,

249
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,163
 I always like to take an informal poll actually,

250
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,428
 when we start this class.

251
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:46,121
I've taught this a number of times now,

252
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:46,866
 and it's always been a mixed crowd.

253
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:50,009
And I think that's one of the things that's attractive about this class.

254
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,622
So let me ask who are the EEs in this class,

255
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:54,960
 who are in electrical engineering,

256
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,479
 either undergraduate or graduate?

257
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,532
 All right.

258
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:58,400
So that's a pretty strong show of hands.

259
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,043
But let me also ask,

260
00:08:59,043 --> 00:08:59,667
 who are the non-

261
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:00,882
EEs in this class?

262
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,038
 All right.

263
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:03,241
That's also a pretty strong show of hands.

264
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,535
The EEs are,

265
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:06,208
 as is typical,

266
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,655
 the majority of the students in the class,

267
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:13,022
 but there's also a pretty strong group of students in this class who are not electrical engineers by training,

268
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:13,638
 by desire,

269
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:14,128
 by anything,

270
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,126
 all right?

271
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:17,624
 And they usually come from all over the place.

272
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,206
I was looking at the classes before I got to class,

273
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,931
 and I think there are some people from chemistry.

274
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,244
Is somebody from chemistry?

275
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:25,974
 I thought there was somebody 

276
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:26,386
！ yeah,

277
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:26,923
 I see back there.

278
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:27,495
All right.

279
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:30,111
And I know there were some people from earth sciences.

280
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,661
And somebody was talking to me actually from earth sciences this morning.

281
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:32,857
Somebody from earth science?

282
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:33,377
 Okay.

283
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:33,887
Where else?

284
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:34,869
 I think there was an ME,

285
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:35,947
 couple of MEs maybe.

286
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,001
Yeah,

287
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:37,671
 all right.

288
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:38,138
Now,

289
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,472
 that's important to know,

290
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:40,516
 I think.

291
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:43,689
The course is very rich in material,

292
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:44,642
 all right,

293
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:45,585
 rich in applications,

294
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,505
 rich in content,

295
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:50,914
 and it appeals to many people for many different reasons,

296
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,554
 okay?

297
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:54,936
 For the EEs who are taking the class,

298
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:58,951
 you have probably seen a certain amount of this material 

299
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,304
！ I don't wanna say most of the material,

300
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:03,865
 but you've probably seen a fair amount of this material scattered over many different classes.

301
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:12,722
But it's been my experience that one of the advantages of this class for electrical engineering students,

302
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:15,619
 either undergraduate or graduate students,

303
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:16,604
 is to see it all in one piece,

304
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:17,297
 all right,

305
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,404
 to put it all in your head at one time,

306
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:19,224
 at least once,

307
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:19,835
 all right,

308
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,906
 because the subject does have a great amount of coherence.

309
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:25,243
It really does hang together beautifully.

310
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,502
For all the different and varied applications,

311
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:32,893
 there are core ideas and core methods of the class that it is very helpful to see all at once,

312
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:33,534
 all right?

313
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,208
 So if you have seen the material before,

314
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,753
 that's fine.

315
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:38,270
I mean,

316
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,623
 you can draw on that and draw on your experience,

317
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:46,061
 but don't deny yourself the pleasure of trying to synthesize the ideas as we go along.

318
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:46,909
I mean,

319
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,395
 there's nothing so pleasurable as thinking about something you already know,

320
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,695
 trying to think about it from a new perspective,

321
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:52,941
 trying to think about it from a new point of view,

322
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:56,561
 trying to fold it into some of the newer things you'll be learning.

323
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:00,409
So I have heard this from electrical engineering students many times in the past

324
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,890
 that it's a pleasure for them to see the material all together at once.

325
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,662
It may seem like a fair amount of review,

326
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:07,144
 and in some cases,

327
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:07,647
 it will be,

328
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,268
 but not in all cases.

329
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,738
And even if it is a review,

330
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:14,134
 there are often slightly different twists or slightly new takes on things 

331
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:17,367
that you may not have seen before or may not have thought of in quite that way.

332
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:20,231
So that is my advice to the electrical engineering students.

333
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:24,940
For the students who have not seen this material before that are coming at it from a different field 

334
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:31,471
and maybe only heard secret tales of the Fourier transform and its uses,

335
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,061
 well,

336
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,534
 I hope you enjoy the ride because it's gonna be a hell of a ride 

337
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,139
！ oh,

338
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,969
 a heck of a ride as we go along.

339
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:38,427
All right.

340
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:38,936
Now,

341
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:41,635
 for everyone,

342
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:42,604
 I sort of feel like I have to issue 

343
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:45,426
！ I don't know if I'd call this a warning or just sort of a statement or principle or whatever.

344
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:46,538
This is a very mathematical class.

345
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:51,682
This is one of the sort of holy trinity of classes in the information systems lab and electrical engineering.

346
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,185
Electrical engineering is a very broad department.

347
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:56,659
It's split up into a number of laboratories along research lines.

348
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,533
I am in the information systems lab,

349
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,748
 which is sort of the mathematical part of the subject,

350
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:01,857
 has a lot of signal processing,

351
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:02,737
 coding theory,

352
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:03,221
 imaging,

353
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,000
 and so on.

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,296
And this course has been for a number of years taught by faculty,

355
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:11,408
 sort of thought of as a cornerstone in the signal processing,

356
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,227
 although it has a lot of different applications to a lot of different areas.

357
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:18,923
The other courses in that holy trinity are 263,

358
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:19,794
 linear dynamical systems,

359
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:21,185
 and 278,

360
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:22,658
 statistical signal processing.

361
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,595
Actually,

362
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,506
 let me ask here because this is also very common:

363
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,824
 Who's taking 263 in the class?

364
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:30,155
 Also a strong majority.

365
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:31,886
And who's taking 278?

366
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:32,439
 Yeah,

367
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:33,077
 okay.

368
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:36,354
So there's a little bit less but still a number of people.

369
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,418
We'll actually see,

370
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:41,083
 not so much with 278,

371
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:41,500
 well,

372
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,159
 actually with both classes,

373
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,420
 with 263 and 278,

374
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,912
 you'll actually see some overlap that I also hope you find interesting.

375
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:48,035
The language will be slightly different.

376
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,607
The perspective will be slightly different,

377
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:56,092
 but you see this material in this class melding over into the other classes and vice-

378
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:56,754
versa.

379
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:57,309
And again,

380
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,974
 I think it's something that you can really draw on and I hope you enjoy,

381
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,526
 all right?

382
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:05,526
 So those classes and the perspective that we take,

383
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,644
 the faculty who are teaching this class,

384
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:08,846
 is a pretty mathematical one,

385
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:11,432
 but it's not a class in theorems and proofs.

386
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,450
You can breathe a heavy sigh of relief now,

387
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,316
 all right?

388
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,895
 I can do that,

389
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:17,890
 but I won't,

390
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,318
 all right?

391
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:21,226
 I will derive things 

392
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,468
！ I'll derive a number of formulas 

393
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:26,278
！ I'll derive it and I'll go through those derivations,

394
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:33,192
 or I'll hope that you go through the derivations in the book when I hope and I think that they will be helpful,

395
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:33,808
 all right?

396
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:34,199
 And when,

397
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:34,881
 in some cases,

398
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,422
 that is,

399
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:39,823
 there's an important technique or there's an important idea that you'll see not only in the particular instance but overall,

400
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:47,183
 that you'll see the same sort of derivation or the same sort of ideas be applied not only for one formula but for other sorts of formulas.

401
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:47,588
And also,

402
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:47,996
 in some cases,

403
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:48,752
 to my mind,

404
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:51,715
 as twisted as that may be,

405
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,598
 I sometimes think of the derivation of a formula almost as identical with the formula.

406
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:56,606
I mean,

407
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:58,845
 to use the formula effectively almost is to know the derivation

408
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,902
 because it's to know where it applies and to know how it applies

409
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:03,431
 and where do we expect to use it,

410
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:04,496
 all right?

411
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:09,900
 So that's why I will go through those things for the purpose of teaching a certain amount of technique

412
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,420
 and for the purposes of sort of having those techniques really at your fingertips 

413
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,595
so that you can apply them again in a situation 

414
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:23,963
that may not be quite identical with what we did

415
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,696
 but will be similar enough so that the ideas may apply in that situation.

416
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,414
That's very important.

417
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:26,748
We will also do plenty of different sorts of applications.

418
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:27,621
And again,

419
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,847
 because the field,

420
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,098
 the subject is so varied and because the clientele,

421
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,181
 because the students in the class are also varied,

422
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,622
 we'll try to take applications from different areas.

423
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,410
We'll have applications from electrical engineering,

424
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,475
 but we'll also have applications from physics and from other areas.

425
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:43,618
I've also done in the past,

426
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,159
 and we'll see if I can get to this,

427
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:45,944
 some applications from earth sciences,

428
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:46,840
 for example.

429
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,287
And we'll just see how that goes.

430
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,030
So we all have to cut each other a little bit of slack,

431
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,577
 and if an application or particular area is not exactly to your liking,

432
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:53,263
 well,

433
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:56,829
 chances are it might be to somebody's liking to your right or left.

434
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,600
So,

435
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,597
 as I say,

436
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,806
 everybody should cut each other a little slack and just enjoy the ride.

437
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:09,506
I should also say that many of the more specialized applications are found in more specialized courses,

438
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:10,327
 all right?

439
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,190
 So we will touch on a lot of things,

440
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,070
 and I will use the words that are used in a lot of different courses and a lot of different subjects.

441
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,993
But we won't always do C in application to its bitter end,

442
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:20,978
 so to speak,

443
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:21,534
 or we won't do every 

444
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:25,198
！ we certainly won't do every possible application because there are just so many of them.

445
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,961
So you will find you will not run out of ways of using the Fourier transform 

446
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:33,331
and Fourier analysis techniques in any classes here.

447
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,885
It goes on and on and on.

448
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:40,049
But we'll only be able to see a certain amount of that,

449
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:40,840
 all right?

450
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,490
 And actually,

451
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,119
 that leads to a very important point,

452
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,038
 at least at the start of the class; that is,

453
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:47,485
 where do we start,

454
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:48,264
 all right?

455
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:48,853
 That is,

456
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:49,439
 this subject,

457
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,910
 which is so rich and so diverse,

458
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,334
 forces you,

459
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,085
 forces me,

460
00:15:55,085 --> 00:16:00,400
 forces all of us to make hard choices in some ways about what we're gonna cover,

461
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,123
 where we're gonna start,

462
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:01,926
 what direction we're going to go.

463
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:06,010
And all the different choices are defensible.

464
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,770
You will find books out there that take very different tactics towards the subject.

465
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,021
They take different starting points; they have different emphasis; they go off in different directions.

466
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,677
And you can make a good argument for any one of those choices.

467
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,432
But you have to make a choice.

468
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:27,580
So for us,

469
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,649
 we are going to choose 

470
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,325
！ I have chosen,

471
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:31,947
 not we,

472
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:32,530
 me 

473
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:38,346
！ I have chosen to start the class with a brief discussion of Fourier series 

474
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:42,335
and go from there to the Fourier transform,

475
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,230
 all right,

476
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,873
 whereas it is also a very common choice to forget about Fourier series 

477
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:52,833
and maybe pick them up a little bit along the end or pick them up a little bit on the edges or,

478
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,984
 assuming that everybody's seen Fourier series,

479
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:54,440
 and then go right into the Fourier transform.

480
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,120
I don't wanna do that because I think the subject of Fourier series is interesting enough in it 

481
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,520
！ we're not gonna do very much with it,

482
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,681
 but it's interesting enough in itself.

483
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:01,319
Again,

484
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,559
 it's something you may have seen in different contexts,

485
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,081
 but it provides a natural transition to the study of the Fourier transform.

486
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:12,189
And it is historically actually the way the subject developed,

487
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:12,706
 okay?

488
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:15,766
 So that's how we're gonna do things.

489
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:21,343
We'll start with Fourier series and use them as a transition to Fourier transform.

490
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:22,029
Now,

491
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,104
 first of all,

492
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:26,600
 what is this concerned with overall?

493
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,357
 It may be a little bit too strong a statement,

494
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:33,184
 but for our purposes,

495
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:41,149
 I wanna identify the idea of Fourier series as almost identified with the study of periodic phenomena,

496
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,780
 all right?

497
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,316
 So for us,

498
00:17:44,316 --> 00:18:03,075
 it's identified most strongly with a mathematical analysis of periodic phenomena.

499
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,613
Now,

500
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:06,681
 it certainly shouldn't be necessary for me to justify periodic phenomena

501
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:08,423
 as an important class of phenomena.

502
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:12,388
You have been studying these things for your entire life pretty much.

503
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:15,807
Ever since the first physics course you ever took where they do the harmonic oscillator,

504
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:20,510
 and then the second physics course you took where they did the harmonic oscillator,

505
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,102
 and then the third physics course you took where they did the harmonic oscillator,

506
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,212
 you have been studying periodic phenomena,

507
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:26,208
 all right?

508
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,857
 So that shouldn't be a controversial choice.

509
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,363
Fourier series goes much beyond that,

510
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:33,685
 but it is first and foremost for us associated with the study of periodic phenomena.

511
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:36,332
The Fourier transform,

512
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:40,479
 although again it maybe doesn't do it justice completely,

513
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:45,001
 can be viewed as a limiting case of Fourier series.

514
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:50,739
It has to do with a mathematical analysis on non-

515
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,071
periodic phenomena.

516
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:54,642
So if you wanna contrast Fourier series and Fourier transforms,

517
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:57,202
 then that's not a bad rough and ready way of doing it.

518
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,032
As I say,

519
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,391
 it doesn't capture everything,

520
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:00,592
 but it captures something.

521
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:07,406
So Fourier transform as a limiting case,

522
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:09,175
 in a meaning that I'll make more precise later 

523
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:21,889
！ as a limiting case of Fourier series or Fourier series techniques is identified with or has to do with 

524
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:23,533
！ is concerned with,

525
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,855
 how about that for a weaseling way out of it?

526
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:26,792
 

527
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,727
！ is concerned with the analysis of non-

528
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:39,184
periodic phenomena.

529
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:40,612
So again,

530
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,237
 it doesn't say everything,

531
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:44,982
 but it says something.

532
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,373
And one of the things that I hope you get out of this course,

533
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:47,622
 especially for those of you who have had some of this material before,

534
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:52,247
 are these sort of broad categorizations that help you sort of organize your knowledge,

535
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:52,762
 all right?

536
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:53,805
 It's a very rich subject.

537
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:54,985
You gotta organize it somehow.

538
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,735
Otherwise,

539
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,012
 you'll get lost in the details,

540
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:57,468
 all right?

541
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:00,968
 You wanna have certain markers along the way that tell you how to think about it,

542
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:01,752
 how to organize it,

543
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:03,708
 what a particular formula,

544
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,664
 what general category it fits under,

545
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,334
 okay?

546
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:10,215
 Now,

547
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:15,474
 it's interesting that the ideas are sometimes similar and sometimes quite different.

548
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:18,862
And sometimes the situation is simpler for periodic phenomena; 

549
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:21,126
sometimes the situation's more complicated for periodic phenomena.

550
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:23,608
So it's not as though there's sort of a one-

551
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:23,965
to-

552
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,342
 one correspondence of ideas.

553
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:28,268
But that's one of the things that we'll see and one of the reasons

554
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:33,703
 why I'm starting with Fourier series is to see how the ideas carry over from one to the other,

555
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:34,159
 see where they work and see where they don't work,

556
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:34,695
 all right?

557
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:43,318
 Some ideas carry easily back and forth between the two,

558
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:47,104
 some phenomena,

559
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:47,578
 some ideas,

560
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:52,393
 some techniques; some don't.

561
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,584
And it's interesting to know when they do and when they don't.

562
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,336
Sometimes the things are similar,

563
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:58,122
 and sometimes they're not.

564
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:59,045
Now,

565
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,539
 in both cases,

566
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:07,942
 there are really two kind of inverse problems.

567
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:09,096
There's the question of analysis,

568
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:15,780
 and there's the question of synthesis,

569
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,854
 two words that you've used before,

570
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,788
 but it's worthwhile reminding you what they mean in this context.

571
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:27,705
The analysis part of Fourier analysis has to do with breaking a signal or a function 

572
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:30,154
！ I'll use the terms signal and function pretty much interchangeably,

573
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:31,341
 all right?

574
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,014
 I'm a mathematician by training,

575
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,666
 so I tend to think in terms of functions,

576
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,653
 but electrical engineers tend to think in terms of signals,

577
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,307
 and they mean the same thing,

578
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:37,806
 all right?

579
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:43,280
 So analysis has to do with taking a signal or a function and breaking it up into its constituent parts,

580
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,081
 and you hope the constituent parts are simpler somehow than the complicated signal as it comes to you.

581
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:57,597
So you wanna break up a signal into simpler constituent parts.

582
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:04,421
I mean,

583
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:08,022
 if you don't talk just in terms of signals here or you don't use exactly that language,

584
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,507
 that's the meaning of the word analysis,

585
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:10,895
 I think,

586
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:11,814
 close enough; whereas,

587
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:17,649
 synthesis has to do with reassembling a signal or reassembling a function from its constituent parts 

588
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:28,599
！ a signal from its constituent parts,

589
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:35,803
 all right?

590
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,497
 And the two things go together,

591
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:38,949
 all right?

592
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:40,011
 You don't want one without the other.

593
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:44,127
You don't wanna break something up into its constituent parts and then just let it sit there,

594
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:47,483
 all these little parts sitting on the table with nothing to do.

595
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:49,431
You wanna be able to take those parts and maybe modify those parts,

596
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:51,290
 maybe see which parts are more important than other parts,

597
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,974
 and then you wanna put them back together to get either the original signal or a new signal.

598
00:22:54,974 --> 00:23:00,523
And the process of doing those things are the two aspects of Fourier analysis.

599
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,713
I use the word analysis there sort of in a more generic sense.

600
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:07,812
Now,

601
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:10,802
 the other thing to realize about both of these procedures,

602
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:12,334
 analysis and synthesis,

603
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:17,416
 is that they are accomplished by linear operations.

604
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,317
Series and integrals are always involved here.

605
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:22,252
Both analysis and synthesis,

606
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:26,209
 Fourier analysis and synthesis,

607
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:37,524
 are accomplished by linear operations.

608
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:44,280
This is one of the reasons why the subject is so 

609
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,141
！ I don't know 

610
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:50,755
！ powerful because there is such a body of knowledge,

611
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:54,529
 and there's such a deep and advanced understanding of linear operations,

612
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,550
 linearity.

613
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,951
We'll make this a little bit more explicit as we go along further,

614
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:01,417
 but I wanted to point it out now because I won't always point it out,

615
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:01,930
 all right,

616
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,761
 because when I say linear operations,

617
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:05,078
 what I'm thinking of here,

618
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,201
 integrals and series,

619
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:06,654
 all right,

620
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,026
 e.g.i.e.,

621
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:16,477
 integrals and series,

622
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:17,717
 both of which are linear operations.

623
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,340
The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.

624
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,291
The integral of a constant times a function is the constant times the interval of the function,

625
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,377
 and similarly with sums,

626
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:25,878
 all right?

627
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:26,914
 Because of this,

628
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:33,239
 one often says or one often thinks that Fourier analysis is part of the study of linear systems,

629
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:33,961
 all right?

630
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:34,794
 In engineering,

631
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:36,710
 there are courses called linear systems and so on,

632
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,983
 and sometimes Fourier analysis is thought to be a part of that because the operations involved in it are linear.

633
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,206
I don't think of it that way.

634
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:44,904
I mean,

635
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:50,425
 I think it's somehow important enough on its own not to think of it necessarily as subsumed in a larger subject.

636
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:51,062
But nevertheless,

637
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:57,604
 the fact that the operations are linear does put it in a certain context; in some ways,

638
00:24:57,604 --> 00:24:58,423
 in some cases,

639
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:01,043
 a more general context that it turns out to be important for many ideas,

640
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,137
 all right?

641
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:02,784
 So you see 

642
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:19,434
！ you often hear that Fourier analysis is a part of the subject of linear systems,

643
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,386
 the study of linear systems.

644
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:23,243
See,

645
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:34,635
 I don't think that really does complete justice to Fourier analysis because of the particular special things that are involved in it,

646
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:41,422
 but nevertheless,

647
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:42,024
 you'll hear that.

648
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:42,448
Okay.

649
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:42,923
Now,

650
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:43,764
 let's get launched,

651
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:44,223
 all right?

652
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:56,426
 Let's start with the actual subject of Fourier series and the analysis of periodic phenomenon,

653
00:25:56,426 --> 00:26:04,987
 so periodic phenomena and Fourier series.

654
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:05,856
As I said,

655
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:14,783
 it certainly shouldn't be necessary for me to sell the importance of periodic phenomena as something worth studying.

656
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:15,309
You see it everywhere,

657
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:15,797
 all right?

658
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:18,858
 The study of periodic phenomena is for us the mathematics 

659
00:26:18,858 --> 00:26:23,528
and engineering or mathematics and science and engineering of regularly repeating phenomena.

660
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:26,363
That's what's always involved.

661
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:26,887
There's some pattern that repeats,

662
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,984
 and it repeats regularly,

663
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:29,580
 all right?

664
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,170
 So it's a mathematics and engineering 

665
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,969
！ since this is an engineering course,

666
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:40,272
 I'll put that before science,

667
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:41,722
 or maybe I won't even mention science 

668
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:50,815
！ mathematics and engineering of regularly repeating patterns.

669
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:52,877
I'm leaving a couple of terms here 

670
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:57,242
！ I'm leaving all these somewhat vague.

671
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,008
What does it mean to be regular?

672
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:58,795
 What does it mean to be repeating?

673
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,754
 What is a pattern in the first place?

674
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:01,690
 But you know what I mean.

675
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,284
You know it when you see it.

676
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:09,426
And the fact that you can mathematically analyze it is what makes the subject so useful.

677
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:10,182
Now,

678
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:12,006
 I think,

679
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,733
 although again,

680
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,968
 it's not ironclad 

681
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:21,289
！ the trouble is this subject is so rich that every time I make a statement,

682
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:22,312
 I feel like I have to qualify it.

683
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:22,399
Well,

684
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,431
 it's often true,

685
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:25,828
 but it's not completely true,

686
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:29,079
 and sometimes it's not really true at all,

687
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,515
 but most of the time it's true,

688
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:30,976
 that it's helpful,

689
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:31,971
 but not always helpful,

690
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:32,917
 but most of the time helpful,

691
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,252
 occasionally helpful to classify periodicity as either periodicity in time or periodicity in space,

692
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:36,776
 all right?

693
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:39,809
 You often see periodic phenomena as one type or the other type,

694
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:42,587
 although they can overlap.

695
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:55,458
So periodic phenomena often are either periodicity in time 

696
00:27:55,458 --> 00:28:02,864
！ a pattern repeats in time over and over again.

697
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:04,131
You wait long enough,

698
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:05,332
 and it happens again.

699
00:28:05,332 --> 00:28:05,793
So,

700
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:06,319
 for example,

701
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:06,979
 harmonic motion,

702
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:07,490
 so e.

703
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:07,974
g.

704
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:08,324
,

705
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:10,365
 harmonic motion,

706
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:11,194
 a pendulum,

707
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:13,103
 a thing bobbing on a string,

708
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:17,182
 [inaudible] harmonic motion,

709
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:19,569
 or periodicity in space 

710
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:22,706
！ I'll go over here 

711
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:48,560
！ periodicity in space.

712
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,396
All right.

713
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:49,837
Now,

714
00:28:49,837 --> 00:29:00,198
 what I mean here is there is often a physical quantity that you are measuring that is living on some object in space,

715
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:00,733
 one dimension,

716
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:01,175
 two dimensions,

717
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:01,696
 whatever,

718
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:02,778
 that has a certain amount of symmetry,

719
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:03,513
 all right?

720
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:08,427
 And the periodicity of the phenomenon is a consequence of the symmetry of the object.

721
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:10,605
I'll give you an example in just a second.

722
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:12,539
So here you have,

723
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,036
 say,

724
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,040
 some physical quantity,

725
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,757
 physical 

726
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:18,298
！ not always,

727
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:18,914
 but often 

728
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:34,614
！ physical quantity distributed over a region with symmetry.

729
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,810
The region itself repeats,

730
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,337
 all right?

731
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:39,135
 The region itself has a repeating pattern,

732
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:39,593
 all right?

733
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,894
 So the periodicity of the phenomenon,

734
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:43,213
 the periodicity of the physical quantity 

735
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:46,386
that you're measuring is a consequence of the fact

736
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:51,753
 that it's distributed over some region that itself has some symmetry.

737
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:58,075
So periodicity arises from the symmetry.

738
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:01,319
Periodicity here of the physical quantity

739
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,647
 that you're measuring arises because the symmetry of the object where it's distributed,

740
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:10,388
 where it lives.

741
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:10,812
I'll give you an example [inaudible] from the symmetry.

742
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:12,161
Matter of fact,

743
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,259
 I'll give you the example.

744
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:15,463
The example that really started the subject,

745
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:20,616
 and we'll study this,

746
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:28,794
 is the distribution of heat on a circular ring,

747
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,760
 so, e.g.,

748
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,739
 the distribution of heat on a circular ring,

749
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:42,272
 all right?

750
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:46,741
 So the physical quantity that you're interested in is the temperature,

751
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:48,846
 but it's the temperature associated with a certain region,

752
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:52,117
 and the region is a ring,

753
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:55,053
 all right?

754
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,330
 The ring has circular symmetry.

755
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,138
It's round,

756
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:57,960
 okay?

757
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,448
 So you're measuring the temperature at points on the ring,

758
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,262
 and that's periodic because if you go once around,

759
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:07,510
 you're at the same place.

760
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:13,904
So the temperature is periodic as a function of the special variable that describes where you are on the ring.

761
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:16,019
Time is not involved here.

762
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:16,612
Position is involved,

763
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,926
 all right?

764
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,000
 It's periodic in space,

765
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,898
 not periodic in time,

766
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:30,380
 periodic in the spatial variable that gives you the position.

767
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,456
And the periodicity arises because the object itself is symmetric because the object repeats.

768
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:40,007
This sort of example is why one often sees 

769
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:41,960
！ and this actually turns out to be very far-

770
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,728
 reaching and quite deep 

771
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:46,776
！ that Fourier analysis is often associated with questions of symmetry.

772
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:51,582
In its sort of most mathematical form,

773
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:56,979
 you often find Fourier theories developed in this context 

774
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:59,083
and Fourier transforms developed in the context of symmetry.

775
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,276
So you often see 

776
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:03,618
！ so you see Fourier analysis,

777
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:16,426
 let me just say,

778
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:18,213
 Fourier analysis is often associated with problems 

779
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:21,902
！ with analysis of questions that have some sort of underlying symmetry,

780
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:27,603
 so let me say often associated with problems with symmetry.

781
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:30,875
I'll just leave it very general.

782
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:31,539
This is the very first problem.

783
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:32,329
The problem of distribution of heat on a ring,

784
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:33,593
 we're gonna solve that problem.

785
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:35,883
That was the problem that Fourier himself considered,

786
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:36,577
 all right,

787
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:39,259
 that introduced some of the methods into the whole subject that launched everything,

788
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:39,694
 all right?

789
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:40,134
 So again,

790
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,311
 it's not periodicity in time.

791
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:46,678
It's periodicity in space.

792
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:48,416
And for those of you who have had or may have courses in this,

793
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:52,395
 the mathematical framework for this very general way of looking at Fourier analysis is group theory 

794
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:58,340
because the theory of groups in mathematics is a way of mathematizing the idea of symmetry 

795
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,562
and then one extends the ideas of Fourier analysis to take into account of groups; that is to say,

796
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:09,705
 to take into account the symmetry of certain problems that you're studying.

797
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:10,601
And it really,

798
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:11,177
 as I say,

799
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:11,736
 it's quite far-

800
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:12,418
reaching.

801
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:13,348
We're not gonna do it.

802
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:15,788
We'll actually have a few occasions to go into this but with a light touch,

803
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:16,646
 okay?

804
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:19,291
 I'm just giving you some indication of where the subject goes.

805
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,446
All right.

806
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:20,805
Now,

807
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:26,932
 what are the mathematical descriptors of periodicity?

808
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:29,909
 Well,

809
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:36,883
 nothing I've said so far I'm sure is new to you at all.

810
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:44,339
You just have to trust me that at some point before you know it,

811
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:46,155
 some things I say to you will be new,

812
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:48,095
 I hope.

813
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,946
But one of the mathematical descriptors of periodicity,

814
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:54,518
 again in the two different categories,

815
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:55,093
 say,

816
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:55,519
 the numbers,

817
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:06,042
 the quantities that you associate with either a phenomenon

818
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:09,324
 that's periodic in time or a phenomenon that's periodic in space,

819
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:10,463
 but periodic in time 

820
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:15,667
！ for periodicity in time,

821
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,996
 you often use the frequency,

822
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:18,208
 all right?

823
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:25,465
 Frequency is the word that you hear most often associated with a phenomena that is periodic in time.

824
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:30,058
You use frequency,

825
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,115
 the number of repetitions,

826
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,412
 the number of cycles in a second,

827
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:33,966
 say.

828
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:39,628
If the pattern is repeating,

829
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:41,650
 whatever the pattern is,

830
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,679
 again if I leave that term sort of undefined or sort of vague,

831
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,885
 it's the number of repetitions of the pattern in one second or over time,

832
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:58,127
 all right?

833
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:04,493
 That's the most common mathematical descriptor of a phenomenon that's periodic in time.

834
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,713
For a phenomenon that's periodic in space,

835
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:12,137
 you actually use the period.

836
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:17,949
That's the only word that's really in use in general for the particular 

837
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,945
！ well,

838
00:35:18,945 --> 00:35:20,229
 one thing at a time.

839
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:26,141
So for periodicity in space,

840
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:33,382
 you use the period,

841
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:38,295
 all right?

842
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:44,389
 That is sort of the physical measurement of how long the pattern is before it repeats somehow,

843
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,720
 all right,

844
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,925
 the measurement of how 

845
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,203
！ whether it's length or some other quantity 

846
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,712
！ measurement of 

847
00:35:50,712 --> 00:35:56,288
！ let me just say how big the pattern is that repeats.

848
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,667
They're not the same,

849
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:00,594
 all right?

850
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:04,222
 They have a different feel.

851
00:36:04,222 --> 00:36:08,114
They arise often from different sorts of problems.

852
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:11,394
This is probably too strong a statement,

853
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:16,190
 but I think it's fair to say that mathematicians tend to think in terms of mostly in periodic 

854
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,769
！ they tend to think in terms of the period of a function or the period 

855
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:20,125
as the description of periodic behavior,

856
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,106
 whereas engineers and scientists tend to think of systems evolving in time,

857
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:25,198
 so they tend to think in terms of frequency.

858
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:29,055
They tend to think of how often a pattern repeats over a certain period of time,

859
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:29,813
 all right?

860
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,358
 That's,

861
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,261
 like everything else,

862
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:33,819
 that statement has to be qualified,

863
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,672
 but I get tired of qualifying every statement,

864
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:37,049
 so I'll just leave it at that.

865
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:38,245
Now,

866
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:39,195
 of course,

867
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:42,678
 the two phenomena are not completely separate or not always completely separate.

868
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:43,652
They come together.

869
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,337
Periodicity in time and periodicity in space come together in,

870
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,324
 for example,

871
00:36:47,324 --> 00:36:48,019
 wave motion,

872
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:48,584
 all right?

873
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,927
 That is a traveling disturbance,

874
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,770
 a traveling periodic disturbance.

875
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,922
So the two notions of periodicity come together.

876
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,357
Two notions here,

877
00:36:58,357 --> 00:36:58,955
 periodicity in time,

878
00:36:58,955 --> 00:36:59,893
 periodicity in space,

879
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:03,657
 come together in,

880
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:04,179
 e.g.,

881
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:09,329
 wave motion,

882
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,772
 understood very generally here as a periodic 

883
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,957
！ as a regularly repeating pattern that changes in time,

884
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:19,939
 that moves.

885
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:24,855
This board jumps up a little bit.

886
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:35,311
I think I'd better skip it.

887
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:38,512
So a regularly moving disturbance,

888
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:51,476
 like a group of freshmen through the quad,

889
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:56,477
 just they're everywhere,

890
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:57,583
 mostly regularly,

891
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,410
 mostly moving,

892
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,074
 all right?

893
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:01,008
 Now,

894
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:01,988
 there again,

895
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,386
 the two descriptors come in,

896
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:04,729
 the frequency and the wavelength.

897
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:05,584
So again,

898
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:16,814
 you have frequency and wavelength in a frequency nu and wavelength usually denoted by 

899
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:24,053
！ this is for periodicity in space and then for periodicity in time frequency nu for periodicity in time.

900
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:42,269
That's the number of times that it repeats in one second.

901
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:58,124
This is cycles per second,

902
00:38:58,124 --> 00:39:00,980
 the number of times that the pattern repeats in one second.

903
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,481
So,

904
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:01,876
 for example,

905
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,609
 you fix your position in space.

906
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,450
Both time and space are involved.

907
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,986
So you fix yourself at a point in space,

908
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:10,381
 and the phenomenon washing over you like a water wave,

909
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:10,910
 all right?

910
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,224
 And you count the number of times you're hit by a wave in a second,

911
00:39:15,224 --> 00:39:16,994
 and that's the frequency.

912
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,643
That's the number of times that the phenomenon comes to you.

913
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:21,636
For periodicity in time,

914
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:23,136
 the phenomenon comes to you.

915
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,162
For periodicity in space,

916
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,336
 you come to the phenomenon,

917
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:26,057
 so to speak,

918
00:39:26,057 --> 00:39:27,517
 all right?

919
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:29,281
 So I've fixed myself at a point in time.

920
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,554
A wave washes over me at a certain characteristic frequency.

921
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:32,676
Over and over again,

922
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:33,762
 regularly repeating,

923
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,996
 it comes to me nu times per second.

924
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:39,214
The wavelength,

925
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:40,808
 you fix the time and allow 

926
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:48,307
！ and see what the phenomena looks like distributed over space.

927
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:53,975
So for periodicity in space,

928
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:59,784
 fix the time and see how the phenomena is distributed.

929
00:39:59,784 --> 00:40:08,017
See the pattern distributed over space,

930
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:08,753
 distributed 

931
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:13,074
！ my writing is getting worse 

932
00:40:13,074 --> 00:40:13,791
！ distributed.

933
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:31,169
Then the length of one of those complete [inaudible] is the period or the wavelength.

934
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:35,918
Wavelength is a term that's associated with a periodicity in space for a traveling phenomena,

935
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:37,107
 for wave motion.

936
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:42,459
So the length of the disturbance,

937
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:44,632
 say one complete disturbance,

938
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:45,508
 if I can say that,

939
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:50,430
 one complete pattern is the wavelength.

940
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,520
Now,

941
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,358
 like I say,

942
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:54,871
 ever since you were a kid,

943
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:55,742
 you've studied these things,

944
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:59,374
 and it's really denoted by Landen.

945
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:04,549
But I bring it up here because of the one important relationship between frequency and wavelength,

946
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:08,009
 which we are going to see in a myriad of forms throughout the quarter.

947
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,413
That is,

948
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:12,563
 in the case of wave motion,

949
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:22,885
 there is a relationship between the frequency and the wavelength determined by the velocity,

950
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:24,714
 and that can be two different phenomenon,

951
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:25,762
 all right?

952
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:28,749
 Periodicity in time and periodicity in space may not have anything to do with each other,

953
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:31,281
 but if you have a wave traveling,

954
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,860
 if you have a regularly repeating pattern over time,

955
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,999
 then they do have something to do with each other and they're governed by the formula,

956
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:40,113
 distance equals rate times time,

957
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:42,094
 which is the only formula that governs motion,

958
00:41:42,094 --> 00:41:42,914
 all right?

959
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:55,978
 So the relationship between frequency and wavelength; that is,

960
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:58,604
 distance equals rate times time 

961
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:04,890
！ I love writing this in a graduate course 

962
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:09,182
because it's the only equation in calculus actually.

963
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:13,287
In all of calculus,

964
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:14,570
 I think this is pretty much the only equation,

965
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,271
 used in very clever ways,

966
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:15,995
 but the only equation.

967
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:20,521
And in our case,

968
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:35,329
 if the rate is the velocity of the wave,

969
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,406
 then this translates,

970
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:39,663
 if V is the velocity,

971
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:43,979
 the rate of the wave of the motion,

972
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,250
 then the equation becomes,

973
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,995
 as I'm sure you know many times,

974
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:47,859
 Lambda.

975
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:51,948
That's the distance that the wave travels in one cycle.

976
00:42:51,948 --> 00:42:53,728
It's traveling at a speed,

977
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:54,871
 V.

978
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,012
If it goes nu cycles in one second,

979
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:59,954
 then it goes one cycle in one over nu seconds.

980
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,047
Let me say that again to make sure I got that right.

981
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,809
If it goes nu cycles in one second 

982
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:06,338
！ if it rushes past you nu times in one second,

983
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:07,457
 then in one over nu seconds,

984
00:43:07,457 --> 00:43:09,252
 it rushes past you once.

985
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:12,147
Rushing past you once means you've got through one wavelength.

986
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:15,036
So distance equals rate times time.

987
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:21,681
The time it takes to go one wavelength is one over nu seconds.

988
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:23,885
So I have Lambda equals V times one over nu,

989
00:43:23,885 --> 00:43:27,243
 or Lambda nu equals V,

990
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:29,281
 again a formula you have seen many times.

991
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:29,780
Now,

992
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,006
 why did I say this if you've seen it many times?

993
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:37,065
 Because I never have the confidence that I can talk my way through that formula,

994
00:43:37,065 --> 00:43:38,213
 for one thing,

995
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:39,722
 so I always have to do it.

996
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:40,955
Secondly,

997
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:44,367
 it exhibits a reciprocal relationship between the two quantities,

998
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:45,474
 all right?

999
00:43:45,474 --> 00:43:46,593
 There's a reciprocal relationship 

1000
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:47,732
！ you can see it more clearly over here

1001
00:43:47,732 --> 00:43:50,765
 where the constant of proportionality or inverse proportionality is the velocity,

1002
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:51,238
 all right?

1003
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:53,789
 Lambda is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency,

1004
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,453
 or the frequency is proportional to the reciprocal of the wavelength,

1005
00:43:58,453 --> 00:43:58,919
 at any rate,

1006
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:00,077
 or expressed this way:

1007
00:44:00,077 --> 00:44:01,346
 Lamba times nu is equal to V,

1008
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:13,923
 so there's a reciprocal relationship between the frequency and the wavelength,

1009
00:44:13,923 --> 00:44:19,191
 all right?

1010
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:26,142
 This is the first instance when you talk about periodicity of such reciprocal relationships.

1011
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:28,742
We are gonna see this everywhere,

1012
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:29,359
 all right?

1013
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,107
 It's one of the characteristics of the subject,

1014
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:33,539
 hard to state as a general principle,

1015
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:34,932
 but there,

1016
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:43,953
 plain to see that in the analysis and the synthesis of signals 

1017
00:44:43,953 --> 00:44:46,994
using methods from Fourier series or Fourier analysis,

1018
00:44:46,994 --> 00:44:48,985
 there will be a reciprocal relationship between the two,

1019
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:51,654
 between the quantities involved,

1020
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:52,212
 all right?

1021
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:55,859
 I'm sorry for being so general,

1022
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,140
 but you'll see this play out in case after case after case,

1023
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,464
 and it is something you should be attuned to,

1024
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:02,173
 all right?

1025
00:45:02,173 --> 00:45:02,940
 All right.

1026
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,281
So you may never have thought about this in these terms.

1027
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,387
It's a simple enough formula that you've used millions of times,

1028
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:08,112
 all right?

1029
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:10,265
 You may not have thought about it somehow in those terms,

1030
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:14,454
 but I'm asking you to think about stuff you once saw in very simple contexts 

1031
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:22,230
and how those simple ideas sort of cast a shadow into much more involved situations,

1032
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,821
 all right?

1033
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,438
 The reciprocal relationship between,

1034
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:26,264
 as we'll learn to call it,

1035
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:29,385
 the reciprocal relationship between the two domains of Fourier analysis,

1036
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:30,744
 the time domain and the frequency domain,

1037
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:31,968
 or the time domain and the spatial domain,

1038
00:45:31,968 --> 00:45:33,750
 or the spatial domain and the frequency domain,

1039
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,188
 and so on,

1040
00:45:36,188 --> 00:45:38,350
 is something that we will see constantly,

1041
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,781
 all right?

1042
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:42,396
 And I will point that out,

1043
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:43,217
 but if I don't point it out,

1044
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:43,852
 you should point it out to yourself,

1045
00:45:43,852 --> 00:45:44,800
 all right?

1046
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,875
 You should be attuned to it because you will see it.

1047
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:53,654
And it's one of those things that helps you organize your understanding of the material

1048
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:55,547
 because sometimes when you're called upon to apply these ideas in some context that you haven't quite seen.

1049
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,452
You have to ask yourself 

1050
00:45:58,452 --> 00:45:59,272
！ at least a good starting place is to ask yourself questions like,

1051
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:01,697
 "Well,

1052
00:46:01,697 --> 00:46:04,456
 should I expect a reciprocal relationship here?

1053
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:05,367
" It might lead you to guess what the formula should be or guess what the relationship should be,

1054
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:05,997
 so you'll say,

1055
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,482
 "Well,

1056
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:09,734
 somehow I wanna use Fourier analysis to do this problem,

1057
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,626
 so I should be looking for some sort of reciprocal relationship.

1058
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:18,395
The quantities that I'm interested in somehow should be related in some kind of reciprocal way.

1059
00:46:18,395 --> 00:46:19,359
" And what that might mean might be more or less involved depending on the particular kind of problem,

1060
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,229
 but you'll see it.

1061
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:20,790
Trust me,

1062
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:21,751
 you'll see it.

1063
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,258
Okay.

1064
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,610
All right.

1065
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:31,840
Now,

1066
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,850
 we're almost done for today.

1067
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,598
Why does mathematics come into this in the first place?

1068
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:38,483
 I mean,

1069
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:39,810
 periodicity is evidently sort of a very physical-

1070
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,842
type property.

1071
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,627
Why does it allow any kind of mathematical description?

1072
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:49,610
 Well,

1073
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,824
 it does because there are very simple 

1074
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:54,221
！ maybe not too simple 

1075
00:46:54,221 --> 00:47:00,066
！ mathematical functions that exhibit periodic behavior and so can be used to model periodic phenomenon.

1076
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:08,450
So math comes in because there are simple mathematical functions that model 

1077
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:20,977
！ that are periodic that repeat and so can be used to model periodic phenomenon.

1078
00:47:20,977 --> 00:47:33,018
I am speaking of course of our friends,

1079
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:33,784
 the sine and cosine.

1080
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:34,240
Now,

1081
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,398
 you may think,

1082
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:39,236
 again,

1083
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:42,924
 we've only talked about elementary things in a very elementary context.

1084
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:43,386
But,

1085
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:44,026
 you know,

1086
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,477
 I have a PhD in this subject,

1087
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:47,337
 and I get excited talking about sines and cosines.

1088
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:47,980
I mean,

1089
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,242
 and it's not just creeping old age.

1090
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,091
I mean,

1091
00:47:53,091 --> 00:47:57,817
 I think there's a lot to reflect on here and sometimes the miraculous nature of these things.

1092
00:47:57,817 --> 00:47:59,122
Cosine of 

1093
00:47:59,122 --> 00:48:02,312
！ I'll use T as the variable.

1094
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,103
Cosine of T and sine of T are periodic of period 2 pi.

1095
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:11,238
That is,

1096
00:48:11,238 --> 00:48:22,819
 cosine of T plus 2 pi is equal to cosine of T for all [inaudible] of T and sine of 2 pi plus T plus 2 pi is equal to sine of T.

1097
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:33,166
Why?

1098
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,685
 Dead silence.

1099
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:38,076
Because the sine and cosine are 

1100
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:38,699
！ don't tell me.

1101
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:40,416
I wanna do it.

1102
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:42,669
Because the 

1103
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,440
！ I'll do it over here 

1104
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,845
！ because the sine and the cosine are associated with periodicity in space 

1105
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:53,561
because the sine and the cosine are associated with an object that regularly repeats.

1106
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:56,248
The simplest object that regularly repeats,

1107
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:59,160
 the circle.

1108
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,839
You didn't meet sine and cosine that way first.

1109
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,517
You met sine and cosine in terms of ratios of size,

1110
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:05,331
 lengths of size in triangles.

1111
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:06,733
That's fine,

1112
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,470
 but that's an incomplete definition.

1113
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,582
The real way of 

1114
00:49:09,582 --> 00:49:10,145
！ not the real way,

1115
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:13,230
 but the more sophisticated way,

1116
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,435
 the ultimately more far-

1117
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:19,171
 reaching way of understanding sine and cosine is as associated with the unit circle

1118
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:24,091
 where a cosine of T is the X coordinate,

1119
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:28,151
 and the sine of T is the Y coordinate,

1120
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:31,825
 and T is a radian measure.

1121
00:49:31,825 --> 00:49:32,504
I'm not gonna go through this in too much detail,

1122
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:37,614
 but the point is that the sine and the cosine are each associated with the phenomenon of periodicity in space.

1123
00:49:37,614 --> 00:49:42,136
They are periodic because if you go once around the circle; that is to say,

1124
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:43,870
 T goes from T to T plus 2 pi,

1125
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,692
 you're back where you started from,

1126
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,891
 all right?

1127
00:49:46,891 --> 00:49:47,471
 That's why.

1128
00:49:47,471 --> 00:49:54,536
It's periodicity in space,

1129
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:54,996
 all right?

1130
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:59,280
 That's the definition of sine and cosine that exhibits their periodic phenomenon,

1131
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,522
 not the definition in terms of right triangles.

1132
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:05,360
It's not that the definition in terms of right triangles is wrong; it just doesn't go far enough.

1133
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,676
It's incomplete,

1134
00:50:06,676 --> 00:50:07,497
 all right?

1135
00:50:07,497 --> 00:50:12,108
 It doesn't reveal that fundamental link between the trigonometric functions and periodicity,

1136
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:13,974
 and it is fundamental.

1137
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:15,105
If not for that,

1138
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:18,337
 mathematics could not be brought to bear on the study of periodic phenomena.

1139
00:50:18,337 --> 00:50:22,742
And furthermore,

1140
00:50:22,742 --> 00:50:26,028
 it's clear 

1141
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:29,953
！ and we'll quit in just a second 

1142
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:32,553
！ that it's not just 2 pi but any multiple of 2 pi,

1143
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:33,552
 positive or negative.

1144
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,669
I can go clockwise or I can go counter-

1145
00:50:35,669 --> 00:50:36,690
 clockwise.

1146
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:42,809
I can say the cosine of T plus 2 pi N is the same thing a cosine of T.

1147
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:45,698
And the sine of 2 pi 

1148
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:49,110
！ T plus 2 pi N is the sine of T for N 

1149
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,028
！ any integer 

1150
00:50:50,028 --> 00:50:52,398
！ and 0 plus or minus 1,

1151
00:50:52,398 --> 00:50:53,246
 plus or minus 2,

1152
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:54,126
 and so on and so on.

1153
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:55,858
The interpretation is that when N is positive,

1154
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:56,794
 I'm going counter 

1155
00:50:56,794 --> 00:50:59,264
！ and it is just an interpretation; it is just a convention 

1156
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,018
！ when N is positive,

1157
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:00,655
 I'm going counter-

1158
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,117
clockwise around the circle; when N is negative,

1159
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:03,999
 I'm going clockwise around the circle.

1160
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:07,742
But it's only when you make the connection between periodicity and space 

1161
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:10,172
and the sine and the cosine that you see this fundamental property,

1162
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,547
 all right?

1163
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:13,980
 Now,

1164
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,643
 all right,

1165
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:16,037
 I think we made it out of junior high today.

1166
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:16,966
That was my goal,

1167
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:17,586
 all right?

1168
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:24,539
 What is most amazing and what we'll see next time is that such simple functions 

1169
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,895
can be used to model the most complex periodic behavior,

1170
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,838
 all right?

1171
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:30,316
 From such simple things 

1172
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:31,506
！ from simple acorns,

1173
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,392
 mighty oaks grow,

1174
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:33,784
 or whatever bullshit 

1175
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:34,433
！ oh,

1176
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:35,113
 excuse me 

1177
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:38,472
！ whatever stuff you learn out there 

1178
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:42,886
！ that these simple functions that are associated with such a simple phenomena

1179
00:51:42,886 --> 00:51:45,220
 can be used to model the most complex,

1180
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,460
 really,

1181
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,239
 the most complex periodic phenomena.

1182
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,634
And that is the fundamental discovery of Fourier series,

1183
00:51:50,634 --> 00:51:52,658
 all right?

1184
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:54,704
 And it's the basis of Fourier analysis,

1185
00:51:54,704 --> 00:51:56,377
 and we will pick that up next time.

1186
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:57,022
Thank you very much.

1187
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:57,738
See you then.

1188
00:51:57,738 --> 00:51:57,738
