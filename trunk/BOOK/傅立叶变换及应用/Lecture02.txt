 Okay.
Any questions about anything?
 Anything on anybody＊s mind?
yet,
 so there shouldn＊t be that many questions.
 All right.
 So today,
study and begin a real 每 serious mathematical study of the question of periodicity.
每 with the mathematical study of periodicity.
 And last time I went on,
 at some length,
about the virtues of periodicity,
periodic phenomena in the physical world,
 and also in the mathematical world.
made a distinction,
 perhaps a little bit artificial but sometimes helpful,
periodicity in time and periodicity in space.
 Those sort of two phenomena seem to be,
often come to you in different forms,
of ask yourself which kind of periodicity are you looking at?
 But in all cases actually,
periodicity is associated with the idea of symmetry.
from time to time,
 and if I don＊t mention it explicitly,
course,

particular problem fit into a more general context because,
say it again,
and how it can be applied in so many different ways.
 All right.
general framework and put yourself 每 and orient yourself in a certain way,
and the techniques of the class,
 you＊ll really find how remarkably applicable they can be.
Okay.
 So I said 每 as I said last time 每 as we finished up last time,
just crawling our way out of junior high,
because there are very simple mathematical functions that exhibit periodic behavior,
namely the sine and the cosine.
can be very general and very complicated,
 and the sine and the cosine are so simple.
phenomena?
 And that＊s really the question I want to address today.
phenomena?
 Now,
 first,
 the general remark is,
 how high should we aim here?
 I mean,
how general can we expect this to be?
 So how general?
 All right.
fundamental question here.
 And in answering that question,
mathematicians very far from the original area that they were investigating.
well,
 let me say right now,
 pretty general,
 all right.

 Now,
 not all phenomena are periodic.

 it may not be a realistic assumption.
to realize here what the limits may be,
 or how far the limits can be pushed.

 naturally,
 although many are,
 and many interesting ones are periodic.
even periodic phenomena,
 in some sense,
really physically realizable.
periodic in time,
rather than phenomena,
 but phenomena sounds a little grander at this point.
phenomena that are periodic in time 每 real phenomena,
 they just die out eventually.

whereas,
 as mathematical functions,
 the sine and the cosine go on forever.
 All right.

 But a periodic function,
on forever,
 repeating over and over again.
 All right.
it really dies out?
 Well,
 that＊ll take us awhile to sort all that out.
answer to this,
 and one indication of how general these ideas really are.
homework problem that asks you actually to address this mathematically.
 All right.
you have a finite 每 you can still use 每 still apply ideas of periodicity,
approximation or even if only as an extra assumption.
 So what I mean by that is,
follows.
 So suppose a phenomena looks like this.
something like this 每 let me write it over here.
 So it dies out over a period of time.

 Well,

 But if it dies after a finite 每 outside of a finite interval,

 All right.
 Force this 每 you can force periodicity.
 That is,
by repeating the pattern.
 You can force extra symmetry.
the problem that＊s not there in the beginning.
 So,
 I mean by this a very simple idea.
Here＊s the original signal,
 and I just repeat the pattern.
 So this is the original signal,

 sort of,
 you know,
 extra copies of it that I＊m just inserting artificially,
extend the function to be periodic and exist for all time.

 but for mathematical analysis,

signals which are not periodic.
of periodization,
 and it＊s a technique that comes up in various applications.
 All right.
see the first problem set,
 homework one.
 Now,
techniques for studying periodic phenomena are really pretty general.
 All right.
you don＊t have a periodic phenomenon,
 you can make it periodic,
apply the techniques to study the periodized version of it,
special cases of actually where you＊re interested in the function.
 All right.
that＊s the point of this remark,
so much by insisting that you＊re gonna use sines and cosines,
periodic phenomena.
can apply really quite generally.
 Okay.
 Now,
 let＊s do it.
program.
 So,
 first of all,
 let＊s fix a period in the discussion.
 All right.
specialize and fix ideas,
mathematically.
 So for the discussion,
 let＊s fix the period for the discussion.
 All right.
And there＊s a choice here.
cosine are naturally periodic of period two pi,
for a variety of reasons,
 it is more convenient to fix the period to be one.
 All right.
we＊re gonna look 每 we＊re gonna consider function signals,
one.
 So we＊ll use period one.
 That is,
of time,
 but again,
 it＊s not only periodicity and time that I＊m considering.
gonna say can apply to any sort of periodic phenomena,
satisfying 每 f of t plus one is equal to f of t for all t.
 All right.
as the basic model functions,
 we scale the sine and the cosine,
 that is,
at sine of t and cosine of t,
 we look at sine of two pi t and cosine of two pi t.
signals are sine of two pi t,
 that has period one,
 and cosine of two pi t,
one.
 All right.
 Simple enough.
 Now,
before we launch into particulars,
 is that periodicity is a strong assumption,
analysis of periodicity has a lot of consequences.
function 每 if you know it on an interval of length one,
 and any interval of length one,
know it everywhere because the pattern repeats.
 If you just know a piece of the function,
you know it everywhere.
 So if we know 每 if we know,
 and I say,
analyze,
 if we 每 whatever formulas we derive,
 and so on,
 this is an important maxim.
I＊ll put it in quotes,
 ※know.§ To be a sort of generic,
 infinite, perfect, God-knowledge.
 So if we know a periodic function,
 say period one,
 on an interval,
a particular interval,
 but any interval of length one,
 then we know it everywhere.
right.
 These are all simple remarks.
 Okay.
before in various contexts,
 but again,

appropriate time.
of really quite complicated phenomena.
 Now,take such simple functions of sine and cosine individually,
periodic phenomena?
be, are just the sine and the cosine.
 But the fact is,
yield quite general results.
 We can modify and combine sine of two pi t,t,
 to model very general periodic phenomena of period one.
 Okay.periodic signals of,
 again, period one.
 All right.
 Now, here is the first big idea,
way of phrasing the first big idea.
 When I talk about modifying and combining 每 well,
let＊s first talk about modifying.
what I have in mind is,
 one period,
 many frequencies.
 As far as a big idea 每 one period,
many frequencies.
 I think you can actually find this in The Dead Sea Scrolls.
 Okay.do I mean, one period,
 many frequencies?
 Well, let me just take a simple example.
mean, for example, e.g.,
 you have sine of two pi t,
looks like.
 I＊ll put the graphs over here.
also has a frequency one that is 每 completes one cycle in one second.
as the time axis,
 say, although, again,
 I＊m thinking in terms of time,
mathematical statement.
 It repeats exactly once on the interval from zero to one.
right.
two cycles.
 So this is period one,
 frequency.
 Sine of four pi t is period one-
half,frequency one 每 frequency two,
 but period one-half also means period one.
 All right.
the picture looks like this,
 it goes up and down twice 每 [inaudible] 每 it does,
second.
 All right.
 Zero, one, it repeats.second,
 it goes through two cycles in one second,
 so that＊s frequency two.
 All right.
it also has period one because if you consider this as the basic pattern that repeats,
also repeats on an interval of length one.
 Okay.length one-half,
 but the signals already contained in interval one-
half,the signal also has a longer period.
 All right.
 It has a shorter period,
longer period.
 And let me do one more.
 If, for instance,
 I look at sine of six pi t,
simple.
 All my remarks are very simple.
 This is period one-
third,three,
 but it also has period one.
 You might think of this as,
 I don＊t know,
period,
 or somehow 每 I don＊t know what exactly the best way of saying it because,
 really,
the best description is in terms of frequency not period.
like? Well,
goes up and down three times in one second.
 Let＊s see if I can possibly do this.
 One, two,three. Good enough.
 One, zero,once in one-
third of a second,
 then the next third of a second it goes up and down again,
the next third of a second it goes up and down a third time.
because if you consider this has the pattern that repeats,
of length one.
 Although, in some sense,
that. Now,
 what about combining them?
the same thing with cosine.
 That＊s how you modify the function 每 one period,
frequencies.
 If we combine them together,
 I actually have a picture of it here,
I＊ll just try to sketch it 每 fool that I am.
 What about the combination?
combination,
 I am thinking of a simple sum.
excuse me 每 sine of four pi t plus sine of six pi t.
 All right.
look like?
 Well, it looks like so.
 And I＊m gonna sketch this,
make 每 I wanna make another comment about this in just a second,
Mathematica plot this for me.
 It looks something like this,
interval of length two.
 All right.
 I＊ve plotted it and it goes 每 it＊s kinda nice,
then a little bit like this,
 and then it goes up and then down a little bit farther,
little bit like that,
 and it goes down 每 that＊s the sound it makes 每 up,
 down like that,
then up 每 excuse me 每 and that＊s not two,
 it will be two,
 and down and up,
we go.
 Two. And then it repeats.
 Here＊s one.
 All right.
 That＊s the sum.
 Now,period of a sum?
 The period of the sum is one.
 All right.
the terms of higher frequency are repeating more rapidly,
it started until the slowest one gets caught up 每 goes to where 每 back to where it started.
All right.
 The period of the sum is one.
 One period,
 many frequencies.
frequencies in the sum.
 One, two, and three.
 But added together,
 there＊s only one period.
So in a complicated 每 this is a very important point,
 and again,
you＊ve seen before.
 That＊s why I say one period,
 many frequency,
complicated periodic phenomena,
 it＊s really better,
 more revealing,
frequencies that might go into it,
 rather than the period.
 You are fixing the period.
fixing the period to have length one.
 All right.
complicated phenomena.
 That complicated phenomena,
 as it turns out,
up out of sines and cosines of varying frequency.
 AS long as the sum has period one,
we＊re okay.
 One period,
 many frequencies.
that goes along with this.
 Now, in fact,the frequency.
 We can also modify the amplitudes separately,
phases of each one of those 每 each one of those terms.
 So to model complicated,
 perhaps,how complicated?
 We＊ll see.
modify the amplitude,
 the frequency,
 and the phases of either sines or cosines,
just stick with the sines 每 of sine of two pi t,
 and add up the results.
 That is,consider something like this.
 Something of a form,
 say, k going from one up to n,
can consider how ever many of them we want.
 A sub k,
that＊s modifying the frequency 每 plus fe sub k 每 allowing myself to modify the phase.
sub k.每 and I can do the same thing with cosines,
about that in just a second.
 All right. So again,
 many frequencies,
 one period.
 All right.
the lowest 每 the longest period in the sum is when k is equal to one,
 period one.
higher terms,
 they＊re called harmonics,
 because of the connection with music,
discussed in the notes,
musical phenomena as a repeating pattern 每 musical notes.
 The higher harmonics,
higher terms,
 have higher frequencies,
 have shorter periods,
because the whole pattern can＊t repeat until the longest period repeats.
 All right.
longest pattern is completed.
 Now,sums. All right.
 That is,the a＊s,
 the amplitudes,
 you can choose the phases,
 and it will plot what a sum looks like.
All right.
 It＊s called 每 so I have MATLAB program with a graphical user interface.

 actually,
 a couple years ago.
MATLAB,
 it was pretty clunky,
 let me tell ya.
 But last year,
 a student in the class,
 in 261,
took it upon herself to modify it,
 which caused me to bump up her grade in the end,
it＊s really quite a nice little program.
 It＊s not complicated,
complicated these sums can be.
 All right.
 So there＊s a MATLAB program,
on the website,
own version,
 which is now on the ash heap of history.

 Unfortunately,

 Anyway,
 so we have to see if we can fix it to work on the Mac,

file,
 and you should fool around with it a little bit.
 Okay?
sense of just how complicated these things can be.
 All right.
 Now,can they be?
 That＊s the question that I really wanna address.
 I mean,
more complicated than just the sine and the cosine alone,
the possibilities that we want to be able to deal with.
 Let me say,discussion, actually,
reasonable way,
like this.because algebraically 每 for algebraic reasons,
 primarily algebraic reasons,
or less convenient ways to write this sum.
 Okay.about it, just a little bit.
t plus fe sub k.
 All right.
 Now,
 you can lose the phase,
 so to speak,
in terms of sines and cosines,
 if you use the addition formula for the sine function.
the 每 the formula for the sine of the sum of two angles.
times the sine of fe k,
 just using the addition formula,

coefficients,
 say sum from k equals one to n,
 little a k times the cosine of two pi k t,
little b sub k times the sine of two pi k t.
 All right.
little ak＊s and the bk＊s are related to the capital A＊s in the phase just by working it out.
All right.
 So capital A sub k times this thing,
phase 每 you haven＊t lost information about the phase in some sense,
 it＊s still there,
it＊s represented differently in terms of the coefficients out in the form of the sum.
right.
 This is a very common way of writing these sorts of trigonometric sums.
matter of fact,
 I＊d say it＊s more common in 每 if you look in the applications,
look in the textbooks,
this form.
 But there equivalent,
 all right?
 You can go back and for the between the two.
And you can also allow for a constant term,
 you can shift the whole thing up.
also usually done for purposes of generality.
 All right.
 You can add a constant term.
it＊s usually written in the form a zero over two,
is because of yet,
 another form of writing it.
 Let me just write out the rest of it:
over two plus,
 again,
 sum from n equals 每 for k equals one to n to n of a sub k,
two pi k t plus b sub k,
 sine of two pi k t.
 All right.
this the dc component.
 I hate that.
 All right.
 But they always do.
 All right.
learned to call this the dc component?
 Yeah,
 I hate that.
 Not everybody,
that.
 That＊s because you think of a periodic phenomena,
don＊t know what you think about.
somehow is a periodic part,
 but then there＊s a direct part that doesn＊t alternate.
dc part 每 direct current part 每 that doesn＊t alternate,
 and that＊s that term.

 you know?
 You＊re sometimes trapped by your language,

 as I will say over and over again,

 You know.
modeling some very complicated phenomena,
 and you say,
 ＆What is a dc component?
somebody gonna look at you,
 like,
 ＆What are you talking about?
＊ You know?
 All right.
Now, so that＊s a very common way of writing the form of the sum,
 but by far,
convenient way algebraically,
 and really in many ways,
 conceptually,
exponentials to write the sum,
 not the real sines and cosines.
 By far.
much the last time I＊m gonna use sines and cosines.
gonna write the expression like this,
 so it＊s by far better.
this. All right.
 Primarily,
 algebraically,
 but also conceptually,
represent sine and cosine via complex exponentials.
 And write the sum that way.
right.
 so what do I mean by that?
 Let me just remind you,
 of course,
n t,
 [inaudible] formula is cosine of two pi n t plus or k 每 or I guess I＊m calling it k,
of two pi k t.
 Oh,
 yes,
 that＊s something else.
 All right.
of principle.
 I is the square root of minus one,
 in this class.
 Not j.
 Deal with it.
 Get over it.
All right.
 For me,
 for this class,
 it＊s i.
 You can use j if you want.
 I will use i.
 Now,
in terms of the completive exponential ant it＊s conjugate,
 that is,
 very simple formula,
cosine is the real part and the sine is the imaginary part.
to the pi i is the real part.
 Two pi i k t plus e to the minus two pi i k t over two.
sine of two pi k t,
 likewise,
minus two pi i k t divided by two i.
complex numbers,
 so if you＊re at all rusty on that,
 you should review that.
 All right.
Because you＊re gonna want to be able to manipulate complex numbers,
imaginary parts.
 You＊re gonna wanna be able to do that with confidence and gusto.
right.
exponentials,
 look over the chapter.
 All right?
 Matter of fact,
 on the first problem set,
complex numbers.
 All right.
 Complex exponentials.
 Now,I won＊t write it out in detail,
 you can obviously then convert a sum which is not gone,
which looks in terms of sines and cosines 每 in terms of complex exponentials.
from k equals minus n to n,
 so it includes the zeros term,
 the constant term,
the two pi i k t.
 All right.
 We are now 每 the C sub k＊s are complex numbers.

 So, All right.
 The c k＊s are complex.
 Now,
on this,
 but I decided not to.
 You can do this just for fun.
coefficients are related.
 So start with the expression in terms of sines and cosines,
coefficients.
 All right.
 You will find,
 actually, a very important symmetry property.
right. These are complex numbers,
 but they＊re not just arbitrary complex numbers,
satisfy symmetry property.
 And it＊s because of the symmetry that the total sum is real.

 That is,
 starting with a formula in terms of sines and cosines,
the formula in terms of the complex numbers.
 All right. Conversely, conversely,
start with the sum of this form,

 then the total some will be real.

 so you＊ll get a real 每 results out of that.
 All right.
coefficients satisfy this,
 then the signal is real.
 And conversely,
you write it like that,
 then the coefficients have to satisfy the symmetry property.
 Yeah?

 Okay.
notations for complex conjugates,
use an asterisk,
 a star,
 some people even use a dagger.
 All right.
true,
 I＊m not making that up.
 But this is the most common notation.
 All right.
another notation I will use.
Okay.
 Now, now, now, now.
 We are ready,
 at last,
at the heart of all of this.
 How general can this be?
 How general can this be?
 I mean,
in the form now,
 algebraically 每 well,
 I＊m in the form now where I can ask the question,
and as we＊ll see algebraically,
approach it.
So we can now ask the fundamental question.
nothing?
 Let＊s kick that one around for awhile.
 The fundamental question 每 so again,
t is a periodic function of period one.
 All right.
 Can we write it,
sum,
 k going from minus n to n of c sub k e to the two pi i k t.
 So again,
ball here.
The fundamental question is this.
 You have a general periodic function,
as a trigonometric sum?
 Can you express it in terms of sines and cosines?
express it in terms of the fundamental building blocks?
 All right.
 By the way,
playing a role here,
 although again,
 I haven＊t said it explicitly until now,
considering linear combinations of the basic building blocks.

 the basic periodic functions.

So that＊s the fundamental question.
 And the answer 每 I＊ll tell you next time.
don＊t think I＊d make such a big deal out of it if the answer was no.
to do.
and far-
reaching investigations.
All right.
 Now 每 but I want to get started on it.
 All right.
 Now,clue.
Student:
[Inaudible] earlier you were starting with one.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Pardon?
 Why am I not starting with one?
 Well,
每 so the question is why does the sum go from minus n to n,
from one to n?
Well, for one thing,
 if it went from one to n,
 the signal wouldn＊t be real,
 right?
Remember there＊s this combination of the positive terms and the negative terms,
right?
of the coefficient,
to give you a real part.
and cosines,
 and then you use complex exponentials to express it this way,
that it＊s the symmetric sum.
 It goes from minus n to n.
 Okay.By the way,
 I should have said something over here,
 I suppose.
 Note one thing,
way,
 that c sub-
zero is equal to c sub-
minus zero.
 Zero being what it is.
is equal to c sub-
zero is equal to c zero bar.
number is equal to its conjugate?
Student:
It is real.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
It＊s real.
 All right.
sure is real,
 others may be real,
 it may just work out that way,
you know is real for sure,
 is the zero of coefficient.
 All right.
 so it must be real.
is real.
 That＊s just a little aside,
 c zero is real.
All right.
 You have to be a little 每 you have to cut me a little slack here.
 Like I said,
all have to cut each other a little slack.
 There＊s so many little bits,
 you know,
little pieces,
 little comments and things like that.
 I can＊t make all of them,
 all right?
hope I put all of them,
 or most of them,
 in the lecture notes,
 all right,
see these things.
 But,
 as I say,
out,
 that you can note,
bigger picture.
 All right.
 But this is one thing that comes up often enough.
 So there＊ll be,
you know,
try to make note of all those things.
 And it＊s hard.
 It＊s hard.
 You know,
facts.
But you＊ll see when the whole thing 每 when you 每 if you keep the big picture in mind,
many cases the details will take care of themselves.
 Really.
 Now,
 where was I?
Yes?
 A secret of the universe.
 All right.
 Here＊s a pretty big secret of the universe,
actually,
 coming your way.
mathematics works,
 and when you try to apply mathematics to various problems,
often have a question like this.
 What if 每 how can 每 what 每 how can something happen?
All right.
 Is it possible to write something like this?
 All right.
 Now,
approach 每 and I＊m serious about this.
trying to look at a mathematical model of something,
 you say,
this?
 Often the first step is to suppose that you can,
 and see what the consequences are.
All right.
 Then later on,
 you can say,
 all right,
seems to be what has to happen.
 All right.
 And then you go backwards.
 All right.
mathematicians will never tell you this because they like to sort of cover their tracks.
They say,
 ＆Well,
 it obviously goes like this,
＊ you know,
 and,
define this formula and that formula,
 and life is going to work out so simply.
they don＊t show you is often that first step of saying,
 suppose the problem is solved,
has to happen?
 All right.
 So suppose you can do this.
from k equals minus n to n,
 c sub-
k e to the two pi i k t.
 What has to happen?
 All right.
Now,
 by that I mean,
 if you can write this,
 what are the coefficients?
equation like this,
 then what I＊m asking here is,
terms of f?
 Coefficient c sub-
k in terms of f 每 f is given to you.
 All right.
unknowns in this expression are the coefficients.
 And the question is,
them?
 All right.
 Suppose you can write it like that.
 Can you solve for the coefficients?
Can we solve for the c k?
 All right.
 I＊m gonna take a very na.
ve approach.
 All right.
gonna isolate it.
 What do you?
 It＊s like an algebraic equation.
equation,
 isolate the unknown.
 So isolate,
 like,
 the,
 I don＊t know,
something like that.
 All right.
 So isolate c m out of this.
 That is 每 it＊s a big old sum,
right?
 So f of t is,
 you know,
rest of the terms.
 That is to say,
 I can write c sub-
m e to the two pi i m t,
the terms that don＊t involve m,
 so let me write it like this.
 Say,
m of c sub-
k e to the two pi i k t.
 All right.
manipulated the equation to bring the one mystery term,
side.
 All right.
 All I did here 每 so f of t is this big sum.
sub m e to the two pi i m t 每 I wanna solve for the unknowns.
 All right.
unknowns one unknown at a time.
 So this is the Mth term in the sum,
the other side of the equation,
terms that don＊t involve m.
 Okay.
 And then,
 write that as 每 that＊s almost isolating c sub-
m,
 and not quite because it＊s got a complex exponential in front of it.
sides 每 this board is not so great 每 multiply both sides by e to the minus two pi i m t.
sub-
of c sub-
k e to the minus two pi i m t times e to the two pi i k t.
 You with me?
my sleeve.
 All right.
 All right.
 Now,
 that＊s brilliant.
of all the other unknowns.
 All right.
 So,
made progress here.
 So we need another idea.
 This is as far as algebra can take you.
right.
 Algebra says,
 you wanna solve for the unknown,
 fine.
 Isolate,
 you know,
your eighth grade teacher tell you?
 Put the one unknown on one side of the equation,
everything else on the other side of the equation.
 Hope and pray.
 All right.
one unknown on one side of the equation,
equation.
 Hope and pray.
 Now,
something to do.
 Let me actually take this out one more algebraic step.
combine those two exponentials there,
 and write this as c sub-
m t minus the sum over all terms different from m of c sub-
minus m times t.
 I＊m just combining the two complex exponentials there.
 All right.
 Great.
Student:
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
What?
Student:
F of t.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
F of t. Picky, picky. All right.
 F of t minus.
 All right.
 Now,good. So now,
 they say that we need another idea.
this moment will think of one or two things 每 one of two things.
differentiate or integrate.
 I mean,
 what＊s beyond algebra?
 Calculus.
 What＊s in calculus?
Derivatives and intervals.
 All right.
 So, here＊s a clue.
 Derivatives won＊t work,
intervals will.
All right.
 We need another idea.
 And that＊s a good idea,
 it＊s an inspired idea.
[inaudible] because it works,
 and I＊ll show you way.
from zero to one over one period.
 All right.
 All I have to worry about here is one period.
Everything＊s periodic at period one,
 so I integrate over 每 I integrate from zero to one.
What if I do 每 what do I get?
Well,
 certainly,
 if I integrate zero to one of c sub-
m d t,
 that just gives me c sub-
m.
right.
 So what about the rest of it?
 So I get 每 I get c sub-
zero to one,
 e to the minus two pi i m t,
 f of t d t,
of the interval 每 let me write this,
每 and the constant comes out 每 c sub-
k, the interval from zero to one,
minus m 每 k minus m 每 t d t.
 That＊s a t there.
 T. Ouch.
All right.
 I＊ve integrated both sides from zero to one.
 All right.
 Now,
 watch this.
right.
 Watch.
 I can integrate that complex exponential,
 that＊s a simple function.
integrate that just like I integrated in calculus.
 All right.
 The interval from zero to one,
to the two pi i k minus m t d t.
 Now,
 k is different from m.
 All right.
 If k is equal to m,
I＊m just e to the zero here,
 I just get one [inaudible] so the k is different from m.
an ordinary function 每 two pi i,
 as you did in calculus.
One over two pi i k minus m e to the two pi i k minus m t,
zero to one.
 Straightforward integration.
 Straightforward integration,
we are almost done.
 We are almost there.
One over two pi i k minus m,
 that makes sense,
 right?
 Because k is different from m,
it＊s not a problem.
m minus e to the zero.
 All right.
 But either the two pi i k minus m,
times an integer.
 That＊s like sine of two pi times an integer,
integer 每 that＊s one.
 And e to the zero is also better known as one.
as one minus one,
 which is better known as zero.
Nothing.
 All this crap integrates zero.
 Excuse me.
 All right.
 Incredible.
upshot?
 It all goes away.
 What is the upshot?
 The upshot is,
 that c sub-
m 每 what＊s left?
What＊s left is c sub-
the sum here are gone 每 are gone.
 They integrated out to zero.
interval from zero to one of e to the minus two pi i m t f of t d t.
All right.
 Now,
 in principle,
 this is known because you start out by assuming you knew f.
Suppose I know f,
 what has to happen?
 All right.
 Well,
 suppose I＊m given f,
as this sum,
 what has to happen?
 Here is the answer.
 All right.
 Here is the answer.
summarize.
We have solved for the unknowns.
 All right.
suppose we can write f of t as the sum,
 k equals minus n to n of c k e to the two pi i k t.
What has to happen?
formula.
 Then you must have 每 I＊ll just write c sub-
k instead of c sub-
the k of coefficient is the interval from zero to one of e to the minus two pi i k t f of t d t.
That＊s what has to happen.
 All right.
It＊s an important first step in applying mathematics to any given problem,
mathematical problem or a non-
mathematical problem.
 Suppose the problem is solved,
what has to happen?
 If the problem is solved,
 mean,
then the coefficients have to be given by this formula.
All right.
 So next time,
 I＊m gonna turn this around saying,
coefficients by the formula,
 do we have something like that,
 and in what sense?
will lead us to great things.
All right.
 So more on that next time.
