00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,224
TheFourierTransformAndItsApplications-Lecture03All right?

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:27,750
 Okay.

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,970
 Let me remind youwhere we finished up last time.

4
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:37,279
 We took an important first step in understanding theanalysis 

5
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:40,655
and undertaking the analysis of periodic phenomena 

6
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,724
and trying to represent ageneral periodic phenomena 

7
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:48,003
by the sum of much simpler periodic phenomena under thisis complex exponential?

8
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:51,128
 So think in terms of sines and cosines, all right?

9
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:55,593
So last time,

10
00:00:55,593 --> 00:01:06,982
 I say we took the first step in analyzing general periodic phenomena via thesum,

11
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:14,045
 so several combination,

12
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:19,443
 a linear combination of simple building blocks,

13
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:24,939
 simpleperiodic phenomena.

14
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,194
 So let me remind you what we did because it＊s very important that

15
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:37,247
you realize what we did and what we didn＊t do.

16
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:43,139
 We said suppose that you can write aperiodic signal in a certain form what has to happen.

17
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,110
 So we start off by saying F of T is agiven periodic function,

18
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,638
 periodic signal. Function, signal same thing.

19
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:49,980
 And just to bedefinite we took it to have period one,

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,753
 all right?

21
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:54,119
 And the question is can it be representedin terms of others 

22
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,109
and suppose it can be represented in terms of other simple signals ofperiod one,

23
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:08,328
 namely the complex exponential.So suppose we can write F of T as a sum,

24
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,183
 say something like this. Okay? K from minus Nto N,

25
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:16,531
 cease of K, E to the two pi I, KT. There was a question,

26
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,188
 by the way, somebody sentme an e-

27
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:21,870
mail about why the sum is symmetric and so why does it go from minus N to N

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,774
and we talked a little bit about this last time.

29
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,117
 This is also discussed a little bit more in thenotes.

30
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:26,475
 You can think in terms of sines and cosines,

31
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:27,279
 all right?

32
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:32,646
 And the idea is that if youhave a real signal the coefficient [inaudible],

33
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,383
 but it bears repeating.

34
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:35,927
 The coefficientsatisfying an important symmetry relationship.

35
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:41,589
 The complex numbers they cease ofminus K is equal to cease of K bar and 

36
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:45,397
because of that the positive frequencies combineswith the negative frequencies.

37
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,570
 The positive terms combine with the negative terms to giveyou a real part.

38
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,379
 So will give you essentially a sum of cosines.

39
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,305
 Okay?

40
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:53,241
Or sum of sines and cosines because the values are complex.

41
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,623
 And it＊s a symmetric sum.

42
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:56,324
Instead of going from one to N or zero to N,

43
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,908
 if you use complex exponentials it goes fromminus N to N.

44
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:07,067
 The proof of the helpfulness of this representation will just becomeapparent as we use it,

45
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,650
 all right? As I said before,

46
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,499
 the algebraic work in the analysis is justmade incomparably easier 

47
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:16,213
by using complex exponentials than real sines and cosine＊.

48
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,560
Just the calculations become that much easier.

49
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,934
 All right.So, once again, suppose we can do this.

50
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:27,229
 Then what we found is the coefficients had to begiven by a certain formula.

51
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:34,509
 So then the coefficients are given by C sub-

52
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:38,781
K is the intervalfrom zero to one, E to the minus two pi I,

53
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:43,278
 KT times F of T, DT, all right?

54
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,823
 It＊s an explicitformula for the coefficients.

55
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:47,830
 And in principle that＊s known, all right?

56
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:55,919
 If you know thefunction then you can carry out the integration in principle.

57
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,303
 And I want to remind youthat this formula 每

58
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,697
 there were two parts of deriving that formula.

59
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:04,231
 There was a sort ofalgebraic part,

60
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:09,838
 where we just try to isolate the K coefficient and that certain way,

61
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:13,085
 but thenthe analytic part invoked a little calculus 

62
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,065
where to solve for the coefficient I had tointegrate.

63
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:21,575
 This depended on a very important relationship of the complex exponentials.

64
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,441
This I＊ll write over here 每 oh, right here.

65
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,415
The interval from 每 I＊ll write it over here.

66
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:29,303
 The interval from zero to one, E to the,

67
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,841
 say,two pi I, NT, E to the two pi minus two pi I,

68
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,359
 MT, DT.

69
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:45,472
 So that＊s interval from zero to oneif I combine the two ended up two pi I and minus MT,

70
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:48,872
 DT. That＊s either one if M is equalto N.

71
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,813
 So in that case I＊m just integrating to the zero,

72
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:52,224
 I＊m just integrating one.

73
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:56,893
 Where it＊sequal to zero if M is different from N,

74
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:59,828
 all right? Fundamental relationship.

75
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:04,148
 We＊ll see thatmaking its triumphant return a little later on.

76
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:04,983
 All right.Now,

77
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:11,007
 that＊s fine and that was a very important first step,

78
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,728
 but it was only the first step.

79
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,576
 Thesecond step is to turn the question around,

80
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:16,275
 all right?

81
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,447
 The first step says suppose we canwrite the function in this form,

82
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,860
 then the coefficients have to be given by this formula.

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,382
 Thesecond step is to turn that around and ask the following:

84
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:30,782
 When is that really possible? SoI want to turn this around.

85
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:33,558
 So, again,

86
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:40,399
 you＊re given F of T periodic of period one,

87
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,607
 all right?I know what the answer has to be,

88
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:48,278
 all right? In a sense, I know what the coefficients haveto be.

89
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,929
 They have to be given by this, so I＊m gonna define them,

90
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:54,576
 all right?Define 每 and I want to use a different notation.

91
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:57,877
 I want to introduce a different notationthat＊s quite standard in this subject.

92
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:01,625
 Define F hat of K to be this interval.

93
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:07,544
 The intervalfrom zero to one of E to the minus two pi I,

94
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,824
 KT, F of T, DT. So, again, in principle youcan compute this,

95
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,462
 all right? You＊re given F.

96
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,936
 You can carry out the integration of F againstthis complex exponential.

97
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:26,484
 And it＊s often then by F hat K and this is called the K three Acoefficient of F.

98
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:31,211
 What did we say? K four A coefficient, all right?

99
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:35,308
 So it depends on F and,in fact, it can viewed as a transform of F,

100
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,037
 although we won＊t use that terminology 每

101
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,240
 well,

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,271
I won＊t stress that terminology quite so much now

103
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,028
 because it will become much moreuseful when we talk about the Fourier transform.

104
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:45,773
 It＊s not the Fourier transform. This isthe Fourier coefficient.

105
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,516
So it＊s a transform of F, but evaluated on the integers.

106
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,057
 For each K,

107
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:53,109
 I have a correspondingnumber F hat of K given by this interval.

108
00:06:53,109 --> 00:07:03,354
 And the question is, do we have 每 can we writethe function?

109
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:10,363
 Can we sit beside the function in terms of its Fourier coefficients?

110
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:18,308
 Can wewrite F of T is the sum K equals minus N to N,

111
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:22,498
 F hat of K, E to the two pi I, KT for sumN?

112
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:24,668
 Is there some sum of these things 

113
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:28,964
that will allow us to express the given periodicfunction in terms of these simple building blocks?

114
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:32,119
 That＊s the question. I say,

115
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,275
 I know whatthe answer has to be if we can do it.

116
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:37,447
 The answer has to be given 每 such an expression hasto involve this.

117
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,699
 That＊s what I talked about last time. The question is does it really work?

118
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,773
If it does,

119
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:48,214
 if a statement like this is true you have to believe that it gives you incrediblepower because,

120
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:49,474
 again,

121
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:53,467
 a general periodic function can be decomposed in this way intovery simple terms.

122
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:58,471
 Analyzing a very complex system of periodic inputs,

123
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:03,696
 periodic outputsmight be possible to do by analyzing what the system does

124
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:07,670
 to the relatively simple inputsand outputs given by the complex exponentials,

125
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:20,886
 all right? So if so we can analyzecomplex systems,

126
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:31,767
 simple building blocks. Not a great sentence here,

127
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:35,654
 but you get what Imean. Simple components,

128
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:40,007
 simple building blocks. I＊d like another try at that sentence,

129
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:42,163
but I think I＊d just rather leave it there,

130
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:47,931
 all right? Okay.Now,

131
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:53,455
 this method is only gonna be really helpful if it＊s fairly general.

132
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:55,673
 And that＊s alwaysbeen the question I＊ve raised a couple times.

133
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,135
 How general really is this?

134
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:09,821
 How general canwe expect this to be if it works?

135
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:10,594
 All right.

136
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:13,966
 Is it worth putting the time and effort into evenaddressing this question 

137
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,761
if it＊s only gonna work in a few specialized cases 

138
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:20,306
that somehowwe can handle an ad hoc basis when they came up.

139
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,607
 Well, let me give you a little warninghere,

140
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,361
 all right? Let me show you the kind of things,

141
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:26,996
 not to be negative about it,

142
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,719
 but let meshow you how high the stakes are,

143
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,540
 all right? This is a very high stakes question.

144
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:40,586
 And letme do that by a couple of examples,

145
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:41,497
 all right?

146
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,435
Examples that are natural enough they can come up fairly easily in applications.

147
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:54,763
 Let＊slook at some examples of some of the kind of signals that could come up.

148
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,897
 For example,

149
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:05,073
you could take a signal that looks like this,

150
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:15,171
 all right? I＊ll draw it over here. I＊ll just drawthe graph.

151
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:17,724
 Something that looks like this.

152
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:20,841
 It could model a switch that＊s periodically on oroff,

153
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,266
 zero or one, current is flowing or it＊s not flowing.

154
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:26,781
 So something like it＊s one for halfa second and then zero for half a second,

155
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:27,740
 all right?

156
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,215
 That＊s the basic period and then itrepeats.

157
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:33,431
 So one down to zero. One-half and then it repeats and it goes up,

158
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:36,672
 then it＊s on,then it＊s off, then it＊s on,

159
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,745
 then it＊s off, and so on and so on. Okay?

160
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:42,272
 So one, three halves,two, and so on and so on,

161
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:42,878
 all right?

162
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:47,010
 That＊s a periodic function and it repeats also for thenegative numbers.

163
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,513
 That＊s a periodic function of period one,

164
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:57,004
 all right? So switch on forhalf a second,

165
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:02,746
 off for half a second and repeats. All right.

166
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:09,903
 Can we expect to write, let＊scall this F of T,

167
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,629
 all right? There＊s the graph,

168
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,313
 and I can write down the formula for it.

169
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:23,776
 Canwe write F in the form? I can compute the coefficients.

170
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:25,152
 I won＊t do it, but, in fact,

171
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,151
 thecoefficients are calculated in the notes,

172
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,696
 all right? You can carry out the integration.

173
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,527
 It＊snot a complicated interval to carry out.

174
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:34,846
 You＊re just integrating the function one over theinterval from zero to a half.

175
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,843
 That＊s all of the function times a complex exponential.

176
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:44,620
 Soyou can compute easily F hat of K. F hat of K would be,

177
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,511
 in this case, the interval fromzero to a half.

178
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:50,725
 Let＊s say, I won＊t carry it out. E to the minus two pi I,

179
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:53,538
 KT times one DT,all right?

180
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:57,749
 It＊s one on the interval from zero to a half and zero on the interval from one-

181
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,738
half to one.

182
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:03,071
 You only compute it on the interval on one period,

183
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,212
 on the interval from zeroto one-

184
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:07,108
half and that＊s an easy interval to figure out.

185
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:20,559
 And we write F of T is sum from Kequals N to N,

186
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,639
 F hat of K, E to the two pi I, KT. That＊s the question.

187
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,626
 And the answer is,no or at least not with a finite sum.

188
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:43,389
 But I hate to build up all this drama asking thisfundamental question only 

189
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:49,457
to answer it no for a relatively simple example.

190
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:53,582
 So the answeris no, not for a finite sum.

191
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:58,094
 Why?

192
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:02,190
 Because the complex exponentials thinking they＊re justsines and cosines,

193
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,116
 all right? They＊re continuous.

194
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,858
 And the sum of a finite number ofcontinuous functions is continuous.

195
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:10,419
 It can＊t possibly represent a discontinuousphenomenon.

196
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,716
 You can＊t represent a discontinuous phenomenon by a continuousphenomenon,

197
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:17,538
 all right?

198
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,339
 You learned that theorem back in calculus,

199
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,257
 you know.

200
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:24,482
 Some jerkof a math teacher probably said something like and the sum of two continuous functions,

201
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,274
of course, is continuous. And you said, yeah,

202
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:29,495
 right. Okay, fine. What＊s the point? Well,

203
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:32,335
here＊s the point right now for the first time.

204
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:35,457
 This limits what you can do. It limits whatyou might want to do.

205
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:41,752
 You can＊t represent a discontinuous function by the sum of a finitenumber of continuous functions.

206
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,982
 Bad luck, all right? Well,

207
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:47,640
 what if a function iscontinuous at least,

208
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,790
 all right? But maybe has a corner. So let＊s look at the secondexample.

209
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,868
 Let＊s say a triangle wave. Something that looks like this.

210
00:13:55,868 --> 00:14:02,164
 Up, down, up, down,up, down, and so on. So on an interval from zero to one.

211
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,853
 So it＊s periodic of period oneand, again,

212
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,389
 the power of these,

213
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:08,904
 along the negative axis also are for negative values of T.

214
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:09,719
So, again,

215
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,588
 we can easily compute the Fourier coefficients.

216
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,008
 That＊s not a problem. Theyexist.

217
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,040
 It＊s not a problem to carry out the integration and,

218
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,140
 again, that＊s done.

219
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,954
 I think it＊sworked out in the notes explicitly and if not it＊s easy enough to do.

220
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:25,624
 I will not do it inpublic. Again,

221
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:35,957
 you can compute the Fourier coefficients.

222
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:39,717
 Has to be integrated in twopieces. Has to be integrated.

223
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:47,058
 The interval from zero to a half of the function T times thecomplex exponential plus the interval from one-

224
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:52,504
half to one of the function of whateverthis is on the corresponding interval times the other times the complex interval.

225
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:53,658
 But youcan do it, all right? It requires a little bit of work,

226
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,571
 but it＊s not hard. You can do it.Can we write,

227
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,642
 I＊ll call this F of T, again.

228
00:14:56,642 --> 00:15:03,825
 My generic error function is always called F,

229
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:04,826
 Fof T. Can we write, again, the corresponding sum?

230
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:07,549
 Sum K equals minus N to N, E to theF head of K,

231
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:14,938
 E to the two pi I KAT. And, again, the answer is no.

232
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:21,304
 Not for a finite sum.Why? Well,

233
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:34,942
 because it＊s your jerk of a calculus teacher probably told you 

234
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:41,040
if your twofunctions are differentiable then the sum of two functions is differentiable.

235
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,359
 And you said,fine, fine, whatever.

236
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,319
 And it didn＊t seem to matter at the time,

237
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:51,066
 but now it matters becausethis function is not differentiable.

238
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,558
 It has a corner, all right?

239
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:55,221
 But the complex exponentialsare just sines and cosines.

240
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,031
 They are differentiable. Their sum is differentiable.

241
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,274
 You can＊trepresent a non-

242
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:04,909
differentiable function as a finite sum of differential functions.

243
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:07,413
 It won＊twork. You just can＊t do it. The right-

244
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:11,123
hand side is differentiable. The left-hand side is notdifferentiable.

245
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:17,106
 Okay? Now,

246
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:23,077
 we could go on like this with more and more bad news,

247
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:28,881
 allright? That is, if there is a discontinuity in 每

248
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:32,421
so here＊s the discontinuity in the firstderivative,

249
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,224
 all right? There＊s a corner here.

250
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,497
 We could draw examples that would looksmoother,

251
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,902
 but we could draw examples where there＊s this continuity in the second

252
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:43,093
derivative or maybe the first and second derivatives are fine,

253
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,901
 but there＊s discontinuity inthe third derivative and so on and so on.

254
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:53,201
 If there is any lack of smoothness, if there is anycorner,

255
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:55,762
 no matter how smooth that corner looks,

256
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:59,056
 if there is some discontinuity in somehigh derivative you＊re screwed,

257
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:03,315
 to use a technical term. All right?

258
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:23,404
Any discontinuity in any derivative includes writing F of T is this sum.

259
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:33,324
 Sum from Kequals minus N to N minus N to N of F hat A,

260
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:34,442
 E to the two pi I,

261
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,987
 KT for a finite sumbecause these functions are infinitely differentiable.

262
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:37,461
 These functions are as smooth asthey can be.

263
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,774
 They＊re sines and cosines.

264
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:41,264
 And you can＊t take the sum of those sines andcosines and put them together 

265
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:44,197
and get something that＊s not infinitely differentiable,

266
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,962
 allright? So this great idea 每

267
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:51,925
 we might as well quit now or take the rest of the quarter off.

268
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,387
Because it doesn＊t look very general at all.

269
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,971
 I mean,

270
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,666
 the kind of signals you come upagainst may have jumps,

271
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,332
 may have corners, may have discontinuities,

272
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:03,668
 whatever. All right.

273
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,521
Maybe we want to make an approximation that they＊re as smooth as can be and then wecan use this.

274
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:09,988
 And it＊s an argument,

275
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:10,924
 but it＊s getting away from what we really hope toaccomplish here.

276
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,090
Let me, before I go any further,

277
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,381
 say that there＊s a maxim lurking here that＊s important,

278
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:17,984
 allright? That is,

279
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:21,963
 if we can＊t represent it as a finite sum 

280
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:25,711
then we have to turn to infinite sumsor at least larger and larger finite sums.

281
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:29,347
 Sums of more and more terms. And the maximthat＊s lurking,

282
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:35,974
 and I＊ll say it now and then we＊ll go back to the general discussion,

283
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:40,239
 is thatit takes high frequencies to make sharp corners,

284
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,585
 or any corners for that matter.

285
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,892
 Maxim isit takes high frequencies to make sharp corners or really any kind of,

286
00:18:43,892 --> 00:19:02,961
 it sounds better ifyou say it like this,

287
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:04,043
 but really any kind of corner, all right?

288
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,672
 Any time there＊s some kind ofdiscontinuity in some high derivative,

289
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:09,179
 that means that you＊re gonna have troublerepresenting that phenomenon as a finite sum.

290
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,339
 You＊re gonna have to take N larger andlarger to try to represent it more and more accurately.

291
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,941
 It takes more and more terms,

292
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,422
 takeshigher and higher frequencies to make that bend,

293
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:24,812
 all right?

294
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:27,498
 Even for a relatively highdegree of smoothness.

295
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:35,546
 All right? Now, by the way, you may think,

296
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:40,872
 again, that his is anartificial maxim that is,

297
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:43,037
 real signals don＊t have sharp corners, but that＊s not true.

298
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:46,950
 I mean,all the time when you, and later when we talk about filtering,

299
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:52,345
 producing sharp corners assharp as you can is actually an important part of signal processing.

300
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:55,462
 Sometimes you wantto take a signal and cut off after a certain point.

301
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,595
 Either cut it off in time or cut it off infrequency.

302
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,131
 Some of you, I＊m sure, have had some experience with this,

303
00:19:59,131 --> 00:19:59,955
 all right?

304
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,627
Sometimes your signal starts out pretty smooth,

305
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,277
 but for other reasons you want to make itsomehow less smooth.

306
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:07,377
 You want to cut things off and cutting things off can introduce 

307
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:11,636
high frequencies in trying to represent the signal

308
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:13,252
 that is something else that has to be dealtwith,

309
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:15,557
 all right?

310
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:16,178
 So there are some very tricky and very practical questions that go alongwith this maxim.

311
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:22,125
 All right. Now, like I said,

312
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:26,439
 at this point you say well what＊s happened tothis grand general program that you＊ve been announcing?

313
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:32,628
 If it＊s not gonna work and if Ican＊t consider finite sums to represent all but the most specialized phenomena,

314
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:38,239
 if there＊sany sum slight discontinuity in there at any level of smoothness,

315
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:43,348
 then what good is any ofthis?

316
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:46,943
 And the come back to that is we have to consider infinite sums,

317
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:52,516
 all right?

318
00:20:52,516 --> 00:21:01,056
To represent the general periodic phenomena,

319
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:13,712
 periodic signals we have to considerinfinite sums,

320
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:19,770
 all right? That＊s a mathematical point. As a practical matter,

321
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,701
 of course, youcan＊t sum up an infinite series.

322
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,387
 You can only sum up an approximation,

323
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:29,379
 but if you want tohave some confidence in what you＊re doing and 

324
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:34,314
if you want to know what errors youmight have to analyze,

325
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:40,979
 the first thing you have to do is realize that you have to expandyour purview from finite sums to infinite sums.

326
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:50,741
 So to represent a more general periodicphenomena we must consider infinite sums of the form,

327
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,842
 say,

328
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,247
 for minus infinity to infinityhalf hat of K,

329
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:58,483
 E to the two pi I, KT.

330
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,284
 It may and be that not all these coefficients are nonzero.

331
00:22:01,284 --> 00:22:03,898
 Some of them may be zero and so on,

332
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:08,725
 but for sure if the function has any sort ofdiscontinuity at any level of derivatives 

333
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:14,600
then these coefficients are gonna go out andyou＊re gonna have non-

334
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,335
zero coefficients as far as you go out, all right?

335
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:20,389
Any non-

336
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:30,389
smooth phenomenon signal will generate infinitely many,

337
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:32,301
 not just a finitelymany,

338
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,155
 but infinitely many Fourier coefficients,

339
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:39,896
 all right?

340
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:45,511
 The only way you couldpossibly have a finite Fourier series is if the function you start out with were infinitelysmooth,

341
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:50,451
 all right? Now, that＊s a problem, all right?

342
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:56,664
 I just want to say the stakes are highhere because if you＊re gonna deal with an infinite sum mathematically,

343
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:57,811
 and even forapplications,

344
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,060
 you have to talk about issues of convergence,

345
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,708
 all right? How accurate is thisgonna be?

346
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,796
 If I cut it off after a finite number of terms,

347
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,491
 how accurate is it gonna be? Allright?

348
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:10,776
 If the series is converging and I cut it off after a finite number of terms maybe I

349
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:14,956
have a certain amount of confidence that I＊m getting a pretty good approximation to myfunction,

350
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:15,593
 all right?

351
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:20,912
But if the series is not converging and I still try to cut it off after a finite number of terms,

352
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:25,594
what confidence do I have that I＊m taking a reasonable approximation to the signal that Ireally want?

353
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:36,589
 So you have to deal with issues of convergence.

354
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:46,132
 You are forced to if youwant this theory to apply at all generally.

355
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:48,645
 Okay? And, again, not just for mathematicalreasons,

356
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:54,527
 but also for practical reasons. Now, that＊s hard,

357
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:55,238
 all right?

358
00:23:55,238 --> 00:24:01,004
 There are a lot of veryhard questions here and we＊re not gonna go into the mathematical analysis of all of them.

359
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,251
I do want to give you a big picture.

360
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:05,100
 I want to give you some good news and some hardnews,

361
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,853
 but ultimately pretty good news,

362
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:10,291
 about how this is dealt with because it has all beensorted out.

363
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:14,011
 But it took generations of mathematicians and scientists and engineersworking 

364
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,827
on this to finally resolve all these issues.

365
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:18,050
Why is this so 每 I mean,

366
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,547
 talking about convergence of series is hard anyway.

367
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:24,527
 It＊sparticularly hard in cases like this because the terms are oscillating,

368
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:27,093
 all right? Thecomplex exponential, again,

369
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:29,009
 think in terms of sines and cosines, all right?

370
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,629
 If I split this upinto its real and imaginary parts,

371
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,930
 sometimes the cosine is positive, sometimes the cosineis negative,

372
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,835
 sometimes the sine is positive, sometimes the sine is negative.

373
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:40,478
 So you havepositive terms and negative terms and adding infinitely many of them up,

374
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,175
 all right?

375
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:46,565
 Soconvergence for infinite sines like this has to depend on some type of cancellations thatare going.

376
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:51,144
 There has to be some sort of conspiracy that＊s making this series converge fora given value of T,

377
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:58,775
 all right?You need a conspiracy of cancellations,

378
00:24:58,775 --> 00:25:01,348
 how about that?

379
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:10,841
 To make such a series convergebecause of the oscillation,

380
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:16,768
 all right? And that＊s hard to study.

381
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:20,689
 That can be hard to study ina given case.

382
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:27,388
 I just want you to be aware of this that the stakes are high and the issues arereal.

383
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:33,508
 Now, here＊s what I want to do. I want to talk about the situation.

384
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:36,468
 I want to give youa number of statements,

385
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:41,151
 theorems that cover what the story is here.

386
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,616
 And, again,

387
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:44,680
 we＊re notgoing to go through the proofs of these things.

388
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,786
 It＊s not so crucial for us the mathematicaldetails.

389
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:51,685
 A lot of them are covered in the notes, not all of them,

390
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:52,435
 however,

391
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:54,658
 and I＊ll say alittle bit more about that as well.

392
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:59,701
 But I do want you aware of where the hard parts are andwhat the answers are,

393
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:01,828
 all right?So what I want to do is,

394
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:10,085
 I want to have a summary of the main results.

395
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:15,968
 That is theconvergence when the function is continuous,

396
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:27,657
 which happens often enough that you wantto know or,

397
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:30,162
 let me say, smooth.

398
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:33,276
 It has to be an infinite series if it＊s not infinitely smooth,

399
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:39,106
all right? The convergence, or what passes for convergence,

400
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:48,182
 when you have certaindiscontinuities and here there is a nice and helpful statement about

401
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:50,473
 when you have a jumpdiscontinuity,

402
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:55,939
 all right?

403
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:59,218
 These two cases are actually relatively straightforward.

404
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,589
 It＊s easyto remember and it＊s easy to have a certain amount of confidence in what the results are,

405
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,171
again. Although, I won＊t prove it. I won＊t go through the proofs.

406
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:11,012
And, finally,

407
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,774
 the convergence issues in general

408
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:19,868
 and they involve some very really quitedeep changes in the perspective

409
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:31,019
 that you have to adopt toward this circle of problems.

410
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,183
Convergence in general, all right?

411
00:27:34,183 --> 00:27:45,753
 You actually do have quite a broad general statementthat covers pretty much all situations 

412
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,665
that come up reasonably in practice.

413
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,976
 But the notionof convergence is a little bit different

414
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:53,217
 and the mathematics involved in here it took a longtime to sort out,

415
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:53,883
 all right?

416
00:27:53,883 --> 00:28:07,311
 So this involves a fundamental change of perspective.

417
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,752
As said, I＊m not gonna do the tails,

418
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:19,020
 but I at least want to say some of the words and I＊lltell you why.

419
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,982
 Because it has become so pervasive that is,

420
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:20,729
 it＊s become so 每

421
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:21,663
 the frameworkfor studying convergence in general,

422
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:22,749
 even as it applies maybe to these simple situations,

423
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,611
has become so standard that you will see this in all the literature,

424
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:25,211
 all right?

425
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:27,348
 You＊ll see inthe engineering literature,

426
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:29,635
 the terms that I＊m gonna use orthogonality,

427
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:32,083
 mean squareconvergence, L2, things like that.

428
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:35,263
 I＊ll say all those words and I＊ll tell you what they mean,

429
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,879
but it＊s become absolutely the way of talking about these things.

430
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:40,838
 And if you look atmodern treatments of signal processing,

431
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:45,786
 and I＊m thinking, in particular, here of wavelimit analysis,

432
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:47,508
 which has become very popular in recent years.

433
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,015
You＊ll hear about orthonormal basis for so and so 

434
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:51,889
and distinguish from the complexexponentials as orthonormal basis.

435
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:55,335
 You＊ll hear all the terminology that goes along withthis point of view.

436
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:56,609
 So I think, at least,

437
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,489
 I want you to come away from this with someunderstanding 

438
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,714
and familiarity with the terminology that goes along with it,

439
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:06,250
 all right?That＊s as far as I want to go with it.

440
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,211
 But even that I hope is gonna be helpful for you.

441
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,846
 Allright. So let me look at these cases,

442
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,873
 because these cases are pretty straightforward andthey＊re good to know.

443
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:15,016
 Convergence when the signal is continuous.

444
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:17,800
 Yes, good news. Itconverges, all right? So that is if 每

445
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:25,438
 so continuous case, all right?So, again,

446
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:29,304
 you can form the Fourier series, all right?

447
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:37,613
 You have that the series sum Kequals minus infinity to infinity,

448
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,082
 F hat of K, E to the two pi I,

449
00:29:39,082 --> 00:29:47,154
 KT converges for each T tothe value F of T point Y.

450
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:51,590
 Is that means that you plug in a value of T into this sum and addit all up,

451
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,801
 then you have a series of constants, and what will it add up to?

452
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,543
 It will add up tothe value of the function F of T.

453
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,438
 So that＊s good, all right?

454
00:29:56,438 --> 00:30:00,734
 If the function＊s continuousthen you know the series is gonna converge 

455
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,839
and it＊s gonna give you the right value,

456
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,473
 allright? Good. Not so easy to prove, all right?

457
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,444
 It takes a little work to prove that and,

458
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:09,744
 again,

459
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:12,231
that＊s sort of sketched out in the notes,

460
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:14,019
 all right? Not all the details, but a number of them.

461
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,456
You can at least see the broad outlines.

462
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:18,086
 And you will find this discussed in various levelsof abstraction 

463
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:20,559
in most mathematical books on Fourier analysis,

464
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,387
 Fourier series, all right?But that＊s what to keep in mind there.

465
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,282
 So the continuous case is good. We call this point-

466
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,762
wise convergence, again, because you plug in a value of T,

467
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:30,999
 a point in time, add up theseries,

468
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,360
 which is then a sum of constants 

469
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,980
and you＊re guaranteed that the sum will convergeto the function F of T.

470
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,383
 In the case the function is smooth actually,

471
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:39,438
 you get a little bitmore. If the function is differentiable,

472
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:42,491
 the smooth case.

473
00:30:42,491 --> 00:31:00,301
 So that＊s if you have variousdegrees of differentiability.

474
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:03,000
 If it has one derivative, if it has two derivatives,

475
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,284
 and thenthere＊s the question about are the derivative＊s continuous and so on,

476
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:07,210
 so I don＊t want tosplit hairs on this. And,

477
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:07,857
 again,

478
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:09,375
 there＊s a fairly precise statement that＊s given in the notes,

479
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,455
but it says this.

480
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,248
 So if it＊s smooth and the particulars continuous,

481
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,766
 so you know the seriesconverges.So, again,

482
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:25,814
 the series converges, the Fourier series,

483
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:27,462
 K equals minus infinity to infinity Fhat of K,

484
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:40,305
 E to the two pi I, KT converges to F of T.

485
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,058
 That＊s the same as in the continuouscase,

486
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:44,767
 but there＊s actually more to it than this that,

487
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:45,684
 again,

488
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,612
 can be helpful sometimes ifyou＊re trying to estimate errors.

489
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:57,096
 You actually get what＊s called uniform convergence andwhat that means 每

490
00:31:57,096 --> 00:32:01,531
 the way you should think about this is for different values of T 

491
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,858
you cancontrol the rate at which the series converges.

492
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:06,701
 Same rate for different values of T. So,

493
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:09,128
again, without trying to make it 每 I can make this precise,

494
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,863
 but I don＊t want to because itrequires too much notation.

495
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:16,667
 So you can i.e. think of it this way, you can control,

496
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:21,071
 or youcan estimate, the rate of convergence,

497
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:28,807
 how fast the series is converging.

498
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:51,657
Add different values of T depending on the degree of smoothness.

499
00:32:51,657 --> 00:33:01,629
 What this often meansis you get estimates on the size of the coefficients,

500
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,282
 you get estimates on the differencebetween the function,

501
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,231
 and a finite approximation, a finite version of the series,

502
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,692
 dependingon the smoothness, all right?

503
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:10,977
 The smooth of the function is the faster it converges.

504
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:12,447
 That＊sone way of looking at it. And, again,

505
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:15,447
 without giving a technical definition of it.

506
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:20,159
 Yeah?Student:[Inaudible]Instructor (Brad Osgood):

507
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,618
Well,

508
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:30,524
 what the uniform convergence means roughly and,

509
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:31,198
again,

510
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:36,828
 what I don＊t want to write I don＊t want to write a lot of epsilon＊s and N＊s andthings like that,

511
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:41,624
 is if this is the function, all right? All right?

512
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:44,120
 It＊s periodics, or the pattern,repeats.

513
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,429
 Then what I mean by uniform convergence is that if you look at a finiteapproximation,

514
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,568
 so if you look at a finite version of the sum just going from minus N to N,

515
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:58,155
then that will track. So this is F of T, all right?

516
00:33:58,155 --> 00:33:59,582
 That＊s the original function.

517
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,074
 And theapproximation does something like,

518
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:06,042
 you know, it tracks the function along the way.

519
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:09,591
 Thisis [inaudible] sum, all right?

520
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:15,546
 You can estimate uniformly over the interval how far theapproximation is from the function,

521
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:16,568
 all right?

522
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:19,770
So instead of just saying at a particular point the series is converging,

523
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,433
 all right? So, again,

524
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:25,396
if I pick a particular point here then the value of the approximation

525
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,903
 is approaching thevalue of the function.

526
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:27,504
 That＊s fine.

527
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:28,718
 That＊s what happens for the continuous case.

528
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,784
 For thesmooth case, you can say more than that.

529
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,076
 You can say uniformly how close theapproximation is to the function over the entire interval,

530
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,686
 over all from zero to one, allright? And you can give an estimate for that,

531
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:40,506
 all right?

532
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:43,212
 That＊s what the smoothness givesfor you,

533
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,641
 all right? And, again, you could write that down precisely,

534
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:48,071
 but I＊m not gonna dothat.

535
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:49,858
There is actually a statement of this theorem that＊s given in the notes,

536
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:51,326
 if you＊re interested.And it＊s interesting.

537
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:52,842
 I mean, and, again,

538
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:57,298
 it can have some practical implications becauseyou＊re never gonna work with an infinite series in practice.

539
00:34:57,298 --> 00:34:59,667
 You＊re always gonna workwith a finite approximation.

540
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,706
 So the question is can you estimate the error?

541
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:02,538
 If you＊re calledupon,

542
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:06,543
 can you give some reasonable estimate for how far off you are?

543
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:12,813
 Not just at a point,

544
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:13,660
but uniformly over the interval where you＊re interested in making the approximation.

545
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,336
 Soit can come up.

546
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:24,529
 So you have uniform estimate of the closeness.

547
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:26,229
 Okay? All right.

548
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:28,252
So that＊s the continuous case and the smooth case.

549
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,819
 So that＊s good news, all right? That＊sgood news.

550
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:30,579
 That＊s nice.

551
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:33,536
 If the function is continuous the series are converging.

552
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:35,266
 If thefunction is smooth the series is converging and it actually,

553
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,521
 sort of,

554
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:38,568
 stays uniformly closeto the given function.

555
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:39,480
 Now, I want to jump back, actually,

556
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,392
 to the discontinuous casebecause there is one situation 

557
00:35:41,392 --> 00:35:45,476
that comes up often enough in practice that it＊s useful toknow about and that＊s 

558
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,299
when you have a jump discontinuity.

559
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:48,754
 And, again, I＊m not gonnaprove this,

560
00:35:48,754 --> 00:36:01,335
 but I think you should be aware of it and there＊s actually gonna be someproblems that use it,

561
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:07,852
 or a problem that uses it. So if you have a jump discontinuity,

562
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:15,651
functions can fail to be continuous in a lot of different ways.

563
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,654
 The simplest way a functioncan fail to be continuous 

564
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:21,007
if it has a jump discontinuity like the first example that Ishowed.

565
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:25,355
So the example of a switch where it＊s on,

566
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:27,650
 then off, all right? Something like this,

567
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,137
 allright? Where the signal jumps down or up.

568
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:37,413
 Okay? So EG. And there the theorem is,

569
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:48,668
 thatis if a T knot is a point of jump discontinuity,

570
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:52,670
 this is a really cool result actually. Thenthis converges,

571
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,703
 then the sum minus infinity to infinity 每

572
00:36:57,703 --> 00:37:00,939
 well, yeah. I＊ll put it like this.Minus two pi I,

573
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:07,750
 KT, sorry, sorry, sorry. F hat of K, the Fourier series,

574
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:16,991
 F hat of K, E to thetwo pi I, KT does converge at T knot.

575
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:18,639
 It converges at the jump discontinuity,

576
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,013
 but thefunction doesn＊t really have a value of T knot,

577
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:21,390
 because it jumps. But it converges,actually,

578
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,050
 to the average value, all right?

579
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:31,773
 It converges to the point in the middle of thejump,

580
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:40,022
 to the average of the jump i.e. to one-half 每

581
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:44,382
 let me write it like this one-half F of Tknot.

582
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:48,171
 This is usually the way it＊s written. F of T knot plus F of T knot minus,

583
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:48,769
 all right?

584
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:54,135
So what I mean by that is you＊re approaching T knot from the left,

585
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:56,137
 that＊s F of T knotminus, it has this value.

586
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,922
 You approach F of T knot from the right it has this value,

587
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:01,464
 that＊s Fof T knot plus, all right?

588
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:03,974
 They＊re two different values of jumps and if you look at theaverage of the jump,

589
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:06,621
 right in the middle, that＊s what it converges to,

590
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:09,957
 all right? Kind ofcool. And this wasn＊t proved until,

591
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,317
 I think, the 1900＊s,

592
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,978
 sometime in the early part of the1900＊s.

593
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:18,093
 So this was way after Fourier had done his initial work 

594
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,982
and people werestruggling with a lot of these problems.

595
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:22,649
 And this is useful enough that it comes up inapplications.

596
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:25,803
 So, for example, for the saw tooth, or not the saw tooth,

597
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:31,601
 for the switchperiodic signal here,

598
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:36,242
 if it jumps from zero to one then at a value of discontinuityconverges to one-

599
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:37,319
half, all right?

600
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:43,682
So even sometimes people define this function to be one on the interval from zero to one-

601
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:44,974
half, leaving out one-half. One-

602
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:48,551
half at the discontinuity and zero from here to here,

603
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:50,633
 right?You sometimes see that definition given.

604
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:54,261
 And the reason why people sometimes give thatdefinition is because they want to anticipate this result.

605
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:58,190
 So if they want to use Fourier＊sseries, they say that that,

606
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,795
 you know, it＊s, sort of,

607
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,316
 consistent with the definition of thefunction in consistent 

608
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:03,168
with the property of the convergence of the Fourier series.

609
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,812
 This isnot so easy to prove, all right?

610
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,171
 None of these things are really easy to prove.

611
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:07,983
 It requires alot of work, all right?

612
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:09,885
 It requires a lot of estimates and careful analysis,

613
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:11,019
 but it＊s nice.

614
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,196
 It＊svery satisfying in some sense that it tells you 每

615
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,823
 at least you know what the situation is.

616
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:16,592
I＊m not saying it＊s easy to establish,

617
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:18,303
 but at least you know what the facts are,

618
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:23,856
 all right?That＊s good. That＊s good. Okay?

619
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:27,643
So any questions on that? This should be,

620
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:31,798
 sort of, part of your vocabulary. Yeah?Student:

621
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:33,232
[Inaudible] continuity?Instructor (Brad Osgood):

622
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:34,305
Then that＊s not a jump discontinuity, all right?

623
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,413
 What I meanby jump discontinuity,

624
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,653
 I mean it jumps between two finite values.

625
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:43,684
 Okay? Yeah. I＊mtrying to avoid 每 I mean,

626
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:46,625
 I＊m talking to you in a somewhat informal way.

627
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,217
 I＊m trying toavoid giving very precise definitions to all these things because you,

628
00:39:49,217 --> 00:39:52,180
 sort of, know itwhen you see it, all right?

629
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,498
 You can do that, of course.

630
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:56,437
 You can give very precisestatements here about the uniformity of approximation,

631
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,854
 about how it converges, and soon, but that＊s not so crucial for us.

632
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,592
 It＊s just you should know in general what the bigpicture is.

633
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:04,635
 Yeah?Student:

634
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,412
[Inaudible] point that ever function with jumps,

635
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:10,127
 so what about points wherethere are no jumps?

636
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:11,841
Instructor (Brad Osgood):Sorry?Student:

637
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,163
What about point where there are no jumps?

638
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:15,198
Instructor (Brad Osgood):All right.

639
00:40:15,198 --> 00:40:16,153
 What about points where there are no jumps?

640
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:17,061
 So,actually, perhaps,

641
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:22,088
 what I should have done is give a more careful statement of thecontinuous case.

642
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:26,690
 The more careful statement of the continuous case is the seriesconverges at any point of continuity,

643
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,811
 all right? So if a function 每 if it doesn＊t jump,

644
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,284
 if it＊scontinuous at that point then the series converges at that point.

645
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:32,965
 Okay?

646
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:35,015
 So that wouldactually be a more precise statement of it.

647
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:35,710
 Oh,

648
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,618
 I better not stop asking for questions here,

649
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:38,684
all right? As I say,

650
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:44,290
 I＊m trying to avoid the infinite regression of making the statements asprecise as I can.

651
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,211
 I can do that, but you don＊t want to see that.

652
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:52,592
 All right.And, again,

653
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:56,012
 don＊t underestimate the effort that it took to do this,

654
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:57,019
 all right?

655
00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:00,487
 When Fourierfirst came out with his ideas and we＊ll see that his original application,

656
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:04,706
 actually, onMonday. He was very bold. He actually said any function,

657
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:07,396
 not just any periodic function,

658
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:10,347
because he was thinking of extending a function to be periodic by just repeating it,

659
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:12,841
 youknow. He was thinking of functions, which die ff and then repeating it.

660
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:17,118
 So he madestatements like any function can be represented by such an infinite series.

661
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:19,409
 And peoplewere scandalized by that,

662
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:22,183
 especially if they were French and the French are easilyscandalized.

663
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:26,488
 Bonjour, any function, you are a fool, monsieur.

664
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:34,704
So it caused a great deal of consternation 

665
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:38,030
and it caused a lot of work to get done to try tosort these things out.

666
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:44,747
 So don＊t underestimate the effort that went into getting even thismuch.

667
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:48,601
 But now,

668
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:54,876
 this was still ultimately not satisfying because Fourier really set hissights very high.

669
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:57,547
 But any periodic phenomena, never mind smoothness,

670
00:41:57,547 --> 00:41:59,188
 whatever,

671
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:03,299
 couldbe represented in some sense by a Fourier series,

672
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:07,815
 by this sort of infinite sum.

673
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:10,300
 And to sortthat out and to get to the truth of 

674
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,644
that really required an entirely different perspective.

675
00:42:12,644 --> 00:42:13,922
 So Iwanted to say a little bit about that.

676
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,459
 I＊ll only get to a little bit today and I＊ll finish it up onMonday,

677
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:20,644
 and then we＊ll see some applications of this,

678
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:27,249
 all right? All right.So general case. That is not talking about continuity,

679
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:29,682
 not talking about smoothness, andso on, all right?

680
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:34,095
 In here, what＊s really involved is you need,

681
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:39,953
 we learned after decades,centuries of bitter experience,

682
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:51,266
 you need a different notion of convergence of the infiniteseries.

683
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:55,055
 You learn not to talk about what you think would be the most natural thing,

684
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:58,961
 point-wise convergence, all right? You learned by hard lessons.

685
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:03,075
 You learned it because it didn＊twork. I mean,

686
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:06,324
 ultimately you couldn＊t get an answer that was very satisfying.

687
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:07,333
 In thesecases we＊re fine,

688
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,611
 but somehow under natural and fairly general situations,

689
00:43:09,611 --> 00:43:20,110
 you learned notto ask for convergence of a sum like this,

690
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,144
 F hat 每

691
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:25,104
 let me just put general coefficients inthere.

692
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:28,664
 Cease of K, E to the two pi I, KTM. Even for general series,

693
00:43:28,664 --> 00:43:29,304
 all right?

694
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:33,813
You learn not to ask for convergence of that at particular points.

695
00:43:33,813 --> 00:43:48,123
 At values of T, all right?

696
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:50,362
You＊ve moved away from plugging in values of T 

697
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:53,610
and looking at the series of constantsand asking whether or not converged,

698
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,701
 all right? And that was a hard step to take.

699
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,834
 Rather,

700
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:07,229
what was ultimately learned was you get a satisfying answer if you asked forconvergence in the mean,

701
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:13,049
 convergence on average. I mean,

702
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:16,038
 the proof that it was a goodidea are the results 

703
00:44:16,038 --> 00:44:20,446
that you can get if you take this point of view and it was a hard wonpoint of view.

704
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:28,418
 So you get a better picture, more satisfying picture,

705
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:35,294
 if you ask forconvergence in the average sense or also sometimes called convergence in the mean,

706
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:45,813
 andI will write that down, all right?

707
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:50,739
In engineering terms it＊s also sometimes called convergence in energy.

708
00:44:50,739 --> 00:45:00,602
 You do see thisterm for reasons, which I＊ll explain,

709
00:45:00,602 --> 00:45:03,449
 probably not today, but next time. Okay?

710
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:07,522
 Remindme. All right. Now, what does that mean?

711
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:08,271
 Well,

712
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:09,919
 you need to make some assumption onthe function,

713
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:10,775
 all right?

714
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:13,408
 It＊s not maybe completely general in a sense the function＊sarbitrary,

715
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:17,787
 but the assumption you make on the function is pretty minimal.

716
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:20,914
 So, again, I＊massuming the function＊s periodic.

717
00:45:20,914 --> 00:45:22,740
 So really everything takes place on the interval zero toone.

718
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,195
 It＊s only the properties on the function on the interval from zero to one that mattersfor us

719
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:29,969
 because everything is just repeated after that,

720
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:35,165
 all right?So, I suppose, again, F of T is periodic period one,

721
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:39,972
 periodic period one,

722
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:44,648
 and you alsosuppose that it has the following property.

723
00:45:44,648 --> 00:45:48,526
 That the interval 每 it＊s square interval.

724
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,462
 SquareDT is fine.

725
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,986
 If the interval of the square of F is finite on the interval 

726
00:45:53,986 --> 00:45:58,478
and that＊s not too harda thing to insist on.

727
00:45:58,478 --> 00:45:59,769
 It＊s not too restrictive a thing to insist on.

728
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:01,332
 There are functions thatdon＊t satisfy that.

729
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:04,826
 If a function goes off to infinity at a certain rate on the interval fromzero to one,

730
00:46:04,826 --> 00:46:06,855
 if it＊s unbounded, then it may not satisfy this.

731
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:09,135
 But certainly the functions thatcome up most often in applications 

732
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:10,943
are gonna satisfy a condition like this and

733
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:14,086
 thisactually is sometimes the hypothesis of finite energy for reasons 

734
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:16,677
which we＊ll understanda little bit more later.

735
00:46:16,677 --> 00:46:18,919
 Take this interval,

736
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:21,951
 it＊s often taken to be the total energy of thefunction depending on what the function represents.

737
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,787
 And so you＊re assuming thatsomehow the signal has finite energy,

738
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:27,443
 which is a reasonable physical assumption,

739
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:34,803
 allright?Finite energy. All right. Then as it turns out,

740
00:46:34,803 --> 00:46:38,207
 then you conform 每 the Fourier coefficientsdo exist.

741
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:41,563
 That＊s something that actually has to be proved separately because it＊s aquestion of integrability,

742
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:42,330
 but it＊s true.

743
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,493
 You conform the coefficients F hat of K equals theintegral from zero to one,

744
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:49,495
 E to the minus two pi I, KT as before, F of T,

745
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:51,201
 DT, all right?Again,

746
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:54,177
 so that＊s actually now a separate issue that has to be verified

747
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:57,183
 because you＊re notassuming the function is continuous or anything else,

748
00:46:57,183 --> 00:47:02,873
 but it can be done. And the punchline is,

749
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:03,965
 and it＊s quite a punch line,

750
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,545
 that you still get convergence of the series,

751
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:12,367
 of theinfinite Fourier series, but not 每

752
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:19,668
 and this board is floating up here. Let me do it over here.

753
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:20,902
But not by plugging in points,

754
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:21,816
 but rather in an average sense as follows.

755
00:47:21,816 --> 00:47:33,974
So then I＊ll write it like this. The interval from zero to one.

756
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:38,247
 I want to look at how closethe function is to an approximating series,

757
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:42,492
 so that means a finite version of the sum.

758
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:43,457
 Sothe sum,

759
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:46,668
 the interval of the sum from K equals minus N to N of F hat of K,

760
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:52,924
 E to the twopi I, KT minus F of T squared,

761
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:53,997
 DT, all right?

762
00:47:53,997 --> 00:48:00,902
 So I look at the average of the square of thedifference between a finite approximation of the sum,

763
00:48:00,902 --> 00:48:04,493
 makes perfect sense to form that,and the function.

764
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:14,187
 And the statement is that this tends to zero as N tends to infinity,

765
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:14,842
 allright?

766
00:48:14,842 --> 00:48:17,254
 The series converges of the function in the average sense.

767
00:48:17,254 --> 00:48:19,115
 The series converges tothe function in the mean,

768
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:21,563
 all right?

769
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:25,823
The idea of integrating a function to get an average value is probably not so unfamiliar toyou 每

770
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:27,801
 one second. The idea of integrating the square,

771
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:29,907
 or the difference of the squares,

772
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,141
 isalso probably more or less more familiar to you and,

773
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:33,399
 as a matter of fact, this is exactly,again,

774
00:48:33,399 --> 00:48:35,503
 for reasons I can＊t explain today,

775
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:40,962
 exactly related to the least squares approximationof a function by a combination of complex exponentials.

776
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:43,019
 Now, you had a question?Student:

777
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,570
[Inaudible] convergence in the mean square?

778
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,552
Instructor (Brad Osgood):Pardon me?Student:

779
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:48,246
Is this mean square convergence?Instructor (Brad Osgood):

780
00:48:48,246 --> 00:48:50,358
Yeah. Mean square convergence, thank you.

781
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:50,908
 I sayconvergence to the mean,

782
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:51,838
 maybe I should even call it mean square convergence.

783
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:52,585
 If you＊refamiliar with that term by all means use it,

784
00:48:52,585 --> 00:48:54,010
 all right? So it＊s mean square convergence.

785
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:00,616
 Allright. So the result is 每

786
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:02,573
 that I＊m afraid we＊ll have to quit for today.

787
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,010
 That the function 每 theseries converges to the function,

788
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,294
 right? That is, it makes sense to write,

789
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:13,691
 you write F of Tequals it＊s Fourier series,

790
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:16,934
 K equals minus infinity to infinity, F hat of K,

791
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:20,320
 E to the two pi I,KT,

792
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,849
 but you have to understand what this equal sign means,

793
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:23,130
 all right? In this context, allright?

794
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,495
In this context you have to be careful here what this equal sign means.

795
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:31,913
 It doesn＊t meanpluck value of T and watch the series converge to the value of the function.

796
00:49:31,913 --> 00:49:32,877
 It does notmean that.

797
00:49:32,877 --> 00:49:40,398
 It means that if you compute that interval for a finite sum and let the degree goto infinity here,

798
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:43,230
 then that interval will tend to zero.

799
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,809
 The mean square difference will tendto zero.

800
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,820
 That＊s what that equal sign means, all right?

801
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,340
 That the difference between this anda finite approximation tends to zero

802
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,195
 as the approximation gets better and better.

803
00:49:52,195 --> 00:49:58,737
 Thesquare, interval to square.Now, that was a big change of view,

804
00:49:58,737 --> 00:49:59,509
 all right?

805
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:03,267
 That was a big change in attitude to adoptthat notion of equality,

806
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:04,494
 that notion of convergence, and so on.

807
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:07,700
 And it had profound farreaching consequences,

808
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,967
 all right? And, again, it took a long time to sort out.

809
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:14,136
 And we＊reout of time for today, so I can＊ tell you that.

810
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:19,704
 So on Monday I want to wrap this up. Not inall the mathematical details,

811
00:50:19,704 --> 00:50:23,008
 only so far as to give you what the general picture is

812
00:50:23,008 --> 00:50:24,947
 becauseyou＊re gonna see it beyond this class.

813
00:50:24,947 --> 00:50:26,485
 You＊re gonna see people use this terminology,

814
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:30,441
 usethese ideas well beyond what we do in here,

815
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:34,064
 and it＊s really quite satisfying.

816
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,735
 It＊s a reallyquite thorough and satisfying coherent picture,

817
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:37,671
 all right? So more on that on Monday.

818
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:38,940
