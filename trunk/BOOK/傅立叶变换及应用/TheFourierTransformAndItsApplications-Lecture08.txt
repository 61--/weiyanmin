TheFourierTransformAndItsApplications-
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
We're on? Okay.
 So today 每 first of all,
 any questions?
Anything on anybody's mind?
 If you brought your problem sets with you,
them in at the end of the period today; otherwise,
my office across from my office by close of business today.
 Okay. Nothing?
issues?
 No burning questions?
 Is it the threat of rain that kept people away?
out there now,
 right? Blue skies.
 Sunshine.All right.
 Today, I want to continue down the path that we started last time,
about general properties of the Fourier transform.
 Remember,
of times,
techniques of using the Fourier transform.
 One is to develop specific transforms,
transforms of specific functions that you need to have at your fingertips,
 so to speak,
kind of things that come up often enough that you want to know what that answers are,
what the formulas are.
transform and different combinations of functions,
 different combinations of signals that,
again,
 come up often.
So that's what we're gonna do today,
 we're going down more the second path,
an extremely important operation.
 So we're gonna have three big items today,
which are important in themselves and come up all the time.
 One is delays,
with a Fourier transform when the signal is delayed.
 One,the Fourier transform under a stretch,
 and finally,
 a very general operation,
have now seen a couple times in different forms,
the context of the Fourier transform in its full glory,
 so to speak,
 and that is convolution.
So I want to take each one of these in turn,
you.
 The book has 每 the notes have examples of how they're used in practice,
also have plenty of chance to practice some of these in problems.
show you what the general formula looks like,
 and how it comes about.
So let's first look at the question of delay.
 And there,
 the question is:
by 每 I'm not sure which term you prefer,
 I'm not even sure what term I prefer,
shifted 每 say shifted by an amount b,
 what happens to the Fourier transform?
words,
 if the signal is F of t,
 and that corresponds to a Fourier transform F of s,
gonna use the capital notation here.
 Then if the signal is delayed by an amount b,
the purposes of this discussion,
 that means I consider F of t minus b,
 not F of t plus b.And, again,
 it's always a question of what you mean by delay,
minus,
 but I think this is probably a fairly standard way of looking at it.
question is what happens over here?
 What happens to the Fourier transform?
Now,
 this is the sort of question that you have to be able to answer for yourself routinely.
These are very simple cases,
up, not too many, fortunately. And,
 again,
 we have no recourse here,
with the definition of the Fourier transform.
integral from -
8 to 8,
 e to the minus 2pi, st, F of t, dt.
the signal F of t minus v is the integral from -
8 to 8,
 e to the minus 2pi, st, F of t minus dt.
Now,
 when you get enough experience,
 and by now,
 you probably have that experience,
when you look at something like this,
of variable.
Fourier transform,
anything.
So what you do is,
 the simplest thing is to make a change of variable.
 So u = t - b,
constant.
 So du = vt,
 and t = u + b then.
 And if t goes from -8 to 8,
subtracting off a fixed constant,
 so does u. So in terms of the new variable,
becomes the integral for -
8 to 8,
 e to the minus 2pis,
 t becomes u + b,
becomes F of u, du,
 in terms of the new variable.
And, now, the thing that's crying out here,
 is to manipulate the complex exponential.
write that as the interval -
8 to 8, e to the minus 2pis,
 u times e to the minus 2pis times b,
F of u, du,
 and realize that because I'm integrating with respect to u,
exponential here,
 either the minus 2pi, sb,
 does depend on u,
integral.
 It's a constant,
 as far as integration is concerned.
So I can write that as,
 e to the minus 2pi, sv,
 integral from -8 to 8,
 e to the minus 2pi, su,F of u, du,
 and what remains is the complex exponential,
 this complex exponential here,
times the Fourier transform of F,
 the Fourier transform from the original function F.is,
 this is e to the minus 2pi,
 sb, F of s, what I called F [inaudible].
So where do we start?
 Where do we finish?
 We started by shifting F,
what happened to the Fourier transform.
 In other words,
Fourier transform F of s,
 then the Fourier transform of F of t -minus 2pi, sv, F of s.
 With a similar derivation,
 this is sometimes called the shift theorem,
delay theorem,
 people call it various things; it's very simple and it comes up all the time.
And for me, actually,
up here,
 so that's my own personal burden.
down in general F of t,
 if I change the minus to a plus here,
 I'd have a plus here.
usually write down the formula that looks like this.
or minus b corresponds to e to the plus or minus 2pi,
 sb, F of s.
 It's the same formula,
haven't done anything different,
 but sometimes I like to remember them sort of distinctly.
But that's my own burden.
 This is an example,
 actually,
bit of a problem.
 That is,
 in this case,
helpful,
 indicating how the signal is paired with this Fourier transform,
the signal,
 how does that change the Fourier transform.
operator notation,
 writing this down,
 is kind of awkward,
at t - b,
 you take the Fourier transform that's supposed to be evaluated another variable.
What,
 do I write like this?
 Do I write this evaluated at s?
 That's okay,
only a mother would love; it's just too complicated.
 So we can all understand,
ladies and gentlemen's agreement,
transform of F of t - b.
variables and how you write them; what you write,
 what you don＊t write.
don＊t believe me,
 you'll have plenty of occasions to screw it up,
 trust me,
everybody does.
 It's just the nature of the subject,
like I said,
problems.
 So this is sort of a bad notation in that case,
 although,
it as probably a better notation.
 So the formula itself is very simple.
interpretation of the formula?
 And the interpretation is also something to keep in mind,
and that is a shift in time corresponds to a phase shift in frequency.
 So here,
the sentence.
 Shift in time corresponds to a shift in frequency,
you think is a phase shift,
 corresponds to a phase shift in frequency.
domain.
 Phase shift in frequency.
So why do I say this?
 Well,
 because what I have in mind,
 with a statement like that is,
that the Fourier transform is a complex number,
 so it has a magnitude and it has a phase.
So I write F of s,
 the Fourier transform of the original signal as its magnitude,
magnitude of F of s,
 that's a real number,
 times e to the 2pi, say,
 theta of s.
phase.
your head,
 not only the formula but any interpretation of the formula.
to the minus 2pi,
 sv,
 times the Fourier transform of s is 每 the magnitude stays the same.
And it's this complex exponential times that complex exponential.
theta of s minus 2pi,
 s, theta of s - b.
 I have an s in both cases.
 No, I don't,
 2pi theta of s -sb.
 In general,
 the phase can depend on s.
 That's why I write a theta of s,
vary with s as well; it usually will.
 So there's the phase shift.
 The magnitude is the same.
The magnitude of the spectrum does not change.
does not change.
 What changes is the angle.
however far you want,
 that is if you want to think about other sorts of ways,
basic interpretation of the shift theorem.
frequency and the magnitude stays the same.
 So, again,
that makes sense on physical intuitive grounds,
made up.
 Next, I like these formulas,out.
 This is not as exciting as some of the other things we've done,
 I admit. But,
nevertheless,
be comfortable with.
 And it's not only the formulas,
 it's how the formulas are derived.
One of the reasons why I'm going through this is just to show you,
also show yourself,
formulas.
 Because if you can see them in these relatively simple circumstances,
less simple circumstances.
 It's a pedagogical kind of thing.
 Now,theorem, or formula,
 is what happens when you scale the time.
 And here,
 actually,
is a very important interpretation that I'll talk about after we get the formula,
I think reveals a deeper property of the Fourier transform.
Scaling is scaled 每 when I say scaling,
of scaling of the time.
 If F of t, again,
 corresponds to,
 let me write it like this,
transform F of s,
 and then if I scale the time by a constant a,
real number here,
 but not necessarily positive,
transform?
 So, again, to answer this question,
definition.
 So the Fourier transform of a scale version of F is the integral from -
to the minus 2pi,
 st, F of at, vt. And,
 again, the thing that is crying out to be done here,
a change of variable.
 But it's helpful,
 I think,
 to make a distinction here,
positive or negative,
the limits.
 You know,
 we have [inaudible] definite interval,
have to change,
 and it's helpful here to make a distinction.
whether a is positive or negative.
 So let's take the case when a is positive first.
positive,
 I'm gonna make,
 in either case positive or negative,
of variable to du = a times dt,
 that's clear that I want to do that.
 Then, of course,times dt.
 Now, if a is positive,
 and t goes from -
8 to 8, then so does u; u also goes from -
to 8 because a is just a fixed constant here.
 So the integral becomes the integral from -
8 of e to the minus 2pi,
 s, u/a times F of u; dt becomes 1/a times du.
can factor that out of the integral.
 The integral is from -
8 to 8 and this is minus 2pi.
gonna put the 1/a with the s instead of the u.
 And if I do that,
to see, what remains is the Fourier transform of the original signal F,
but at s/a.
 So that is 1/a times the Fourier transform of the original function,
s but evaluated s/a.
 Fine. Done.Now,
 what about if a is a negative,
 let's take that case.
 So, again,
same change of variable,
 du = a times dt,
 du = a times dt.
 Formally,
 that's all the same.
Now, what happens to the integral?
 So here you have to be a little more careful.
negative, and t goes from -8 to 8,
 then a times t goes from +8 to -8.
skittish when I write integrals.
 They say,
 "You can't do that,
from a bigger number to a smaller number.
" And I say,
 "I just did.
 Nothing happened.
God did not strike me dead.
" So you just have to be careful.-8,
 and then the rest of the integral looks the same formally,
 that is minus 2pi, s, u/a,u,
 and then dt becomes 1/a times du.
 So the 1/a comes out of the integral.
two steps.
 So it's 1/a,
 the integral from +8 to -
8 of e to the minus 2pi,
 and, again,the 1/a to the s instead of u,
 F of u, du. And now,transform,
 I swap it with limits of integration,
 instead of integrating from +8 to -
integrate it from -
8 to +8,
 but then of course I have to change the sign.
1/a times the integral from -
8 to 8 of either the minus 2pi,
 s/a, u, F of u to u,
minus 1/a times the Fourier transform evaluated at s/a,
Fourier transform of the original signal evaluated at s/a.
 Now,two.
 So that's how the two formulas look.
 And they're different,
 sort of,
positive and when a is negative.
 But, really,
that if a is negative,
 minus a is positive.
 In other words,
the absolute value of a times the Fourier transform of s of a,
the original signal evaluated at s/a.
 And, of course,
formula because if a is positive taking the absolute value doesn't do anything to it,
returns to the original value.
 In other words,
 the stretch theorem or the similarity theorem,
whatever term you want to use,
 can be written in one piece.
 I had to the derivation, really,
in two parts,
 but there's only one formula.
 And the formula is,
F of s,transform of the original signal at s/a.
but not on the inside.
Now, suppose if you should say something like,
 of course a is not zero,
 but 每 you know,
take triviality insurance out on all my statements.
trivially false,
 you can ignore them,
 because I know I will.
 Okay.
the stretch theorem or the similarity theorem,
or a similarity.
be the same sort of operation,
than 1.
 And let's talk about that point.
 What is the interpretation of this?
actually has,
 I think, a more fundamental interpretation than the stretch theorem.
the interpretation?
 Well, let's take the case,
 first of all,
 when say, a is bigger than 1.
I'm gonna just consider a positive here.
 So I'll take a to be positive,
bigger than 1.
 If a is equal to 1,
 I'm not doing anything,
 of course.
 If a is bigger than 1,
then how does,
 say,the function F of at compare with the graph of the function F of t?
compare with F of t?
 Well, if a is bigger than 1 then 每 you saw this back in eighth grade,
when you were first learning these things,
argument for how these things look like.
 So if the signal is sort of like this,t,
 then F of at is the same signal except it's squashed; it is compressed.
 Same shape,
or less, but it's sort of a squashed version.t.
 You convince yourself of that,
 that if the variable is bigger,
bigger than 1,
 then I'm squeezing the function.
 What about Fourier transform,
happens on the Fourier transform side?
 On the Fourier transform side,
Fourier [inaudible],
 and then I go to the Fourier 每 if I scale it,
 I go to 1/a,
 F of s/a.
 Now,
I'm gonna draw the graph,
draw the graph of the Fourier transform because the Fourier transform is complex value.
People make this slip all the time,
Fourier transform,
you'd be plotting complex numbers.
 So what people actually plot,
of the Fourier transform,
 is its magnitude.
realization.
 So if this is the original Fourier transform,
 if the signal is real,
of the Fourier transform is gonna be symmetric,
 so it's gonna look something like this.
looks a lot that,
 actually,
my functions.
 So if this is F of s,
 or rather say the magnitude of F of s,
what happens?
 If a is bigger than 1,
 1/a is less than 1.
than 1.
 If I scale it by something less than 1,
compressing it,
 and I'm also multiplying by something less than 1 out front.
actually a stretching in the horizontal direction,
 and a shrinking in the vertical direction.
And,
 again,
 this is not so easy for me to draw,
signal,
 and shrunk.
So it's stretched out horizontally,
 so this 1/a,
because I'm assuming it's positive,
 1/a F of s/a,
 magnitude.
horizontally,
 and it's also squeezed down vertically.
 Is that right?
 How do I say it,
decreased vertically?
 Squashed,
 those are the technical terms,
 squashed vertically.
that's what happens if a is bigger than 1.
 If a is less then 1,
 the situation is reversed.
less than 1,
 then if this is F of t then F of at is stretched out.
Fourier transform,
 that is squeezed together.
 Because,
 again,
scaled by something bigger than 1.
 So,
 again,
over the absolute value of a,
 a is positive,
 1/a,
 F of s/a.
 But,
 again,
 here if a is less than 1,
1/a is bigger than 1,
 so the Fourier transform is squeezed.
transform,
 so to speak,
 absolute value of F of s,
vertical direction,
 because 1/a is bigger than 1 and it's gonna squeeze things down.
maybe something like that.
 So it's squeezed and stretched.
 Now,
cases here.
 Think if a is getting bigger,
 bigger,
 greater,
and less than 1,
 what does it mean?
 Let's take the case when a is bigger than 1,
bigger than 1,
 it's getting larger and larger.
 If a is getting larger and larger,
is getting more and more compressed,
 it is getting more and more localized in time.
the other hand,
 what is happening to the Fourier transform?
larger,
 the Fourier transform is getting more and more stretched out,
 and for that matter,
also squeezed down in the vertical direction.
This is an example,
 an extremely important example,
relationship.
 And I use that term pretty broadly here.
 I mean,in,
 but sort of in words and in feeling you can't have a signal,

 Like, look at the scaling of this F of at for a very large a.

 If you take a signal and stretch it out in time,
 by scaling by a number less than 1,
you know,
 scale by 1/10, by 1/100, by 1/1,000, whatever,
time,
 but you're concentrating it in frequency.
 The Fourier transform is getting squeezed.
That's a very important and a fundamental property of Fourier transform,
and the signal,
 of the signal in the time domain and in the frequency domain,
comes up all the time.
 It's a very important piece of intuition for you to have.
 And to me,
that's somehow the most important consequence of the stretch theorem.
what it says about localizing the signal in time versus localizing the signal in frequency.
A signal cannot be both localized in time and in frequency.
 This is one instance of this.
There are other instances,
 actually,

 of translating this sentence into more precise mathematical terminology.
One of the most famous ways of translating this is the Heidenberg Uncertainty Principle,
that you can't localize a particle both in space and in time.

 by using the Fourier transform.
fact,
 that a signal cannot be both localized in time and in frequency.
out of one domain you're gonna squeeze in the other domain,
 and vice versa.
very important point of intuition for you.
 Now,
 one interesting thing,
what we showed about the Gaussian,
 we showed,
 as a remarkable fact,
transform of the Gaussian is itself.
 So recall the situation with the Gaussian,
the minus 2p t squared.
 When it's normalized this way,
thing, F of s = e to the minus p s squared,
 same thing.
 So from interpreting the Gaussian,
or putting this interpretation onto the Gaussian,
balanced somehow in both time and frequency.
 It is what it is; it is perfectly balanced.
just concentrated enough in time,
spread out enough in time,
 and just spread out enough in frequency.
thing,
 taking the Fourier transform doesn't change it.
 So it's perfectly balanced.
know how better to say this,
 perfectly balanced in time and frequency.
So these things are in general use now and everyday use.
all the time.
without any problem,
 and they are quiet familiar with these interpretations.
 Well,
formula that I won't write down for you,
 but is, again,
 in the notes,
examples of it,
 and I think there's some problems of it,
combine shifts and stretches?
 The formulas get a little uglier,
involved in that,
 but it's just a question of combining the formulas in the right way.
part of it,
 actually,
 is a question of the variables,
everything else.
 So I'm not gonna write down that formula,
couple times,
 I'll get it wrong.
ideas that also comes in is,
and delay,
 so F of at + b, something like that.
 So I'll let you struggle with that quietly.
So one more,
 go out with a bang today,
 and that is to introduce the idea of convolution.
Again,
 something that you've probably seen in other classes,
already seen in the context of the Fourier series.
the context of Fourier transforms,
transforms,
 which is different,
 most naturally different,
coming up in the context of the Fourier series.
differential equations,
 and that same interpretation,
 or that same use of convolution,
again, comes up.
 But that's not the way it's motivated,
role it plays,
 at least for the questions of signal processing.
 So convolution is probably,
think it's probably safe to say,
processing.
 I think that may be a little bit of an exaggeration,
 but not too much.
probably. Most frequently used,
 most flexible important operation in signal processing.
Now,
 what is signal processing,
 since I've used that phrase,
question of signal processing?
 Signal processing,
 very broadly,
might define it as saying,
 how can you use one function to modify another?
use one signal to modify another?
 That's the basic question of all signal processing.
lose sight of this,
 is how to use one function to modify another or one signal?
frequency domain.
 And, again,
the Fourier transform,
 or the inverse Fourier transform.
common to address this question in the frequency domain.
 That is to say,
about modifying a signal,
 most often, not always,
modifying the spectrum of the signal.
of a signal. And then at the end of the day,
 what it is you take the Fourier transform,
screw around with the spectrum,
 that's the technical term for it,
inverse Fourier transform and you modify the original signal somehow.
operations you perform are often conceived of and carried out in the frequency domain,
and then you go back and forth between the two domains,
 again,
or the inverse Fourier transform.
 Now, there's a very simple example of this.
example, linearity actually gives you,
 in some sense,
processing,
 or simplest operation of signal processing,
 e.g.,
 linearity or super position.
transform of G.
G as the one that's doing the modifying.
 If you don't like the spectrum of F,
 fine,
something to it that takes away a little bit here,
 it takes away little bit there,
here,
 adds a little there,
 and then go back.
 So you modify F, F,
 the spectrum of F,
adding the spectrum of G.
 You don't know what G is,
Fourier transform and find out the function that does the modifying for you.
 Usually,the linear to the integral,
 the integral to the sums,
 the sums to the integrals,
think it's really worth commenting on.
 But in some sense,
operation of signal processing; you don't like the spectrum,
 add something to it.
in that light 每 and of course I can also scale by a constant,
some sense.
 That's the other part of linearity is I can multiply by a constant here.
 But,anyway,
 viewed in this light,
 a very natural question is:
 What if I want to multiply?
what about multiplying?
 That is to say: On the frequency side,
function F and I want to multiply it by this Fourier transform and other function G.
I'm scaling each individual frequency,
 so to speak,by some function G that I want to construct,
 that does what I want it to do.
question is: How does that come about?
 That is,the time domain,
 so that in the frequency domain,
 so within the spectrum,
multiply,
 the spectrum of F is multiplied by the spectrum of G.
transform of F are multiplied by the values of Fourier transform G.
 Can I do that?
F of some F combined in some unnatural way with G?
 That's the mystery.
way of combining F and G so that the sequence of the Fourier transform is multiplied?
Not so unnatural. Not so unnatural.
 So to answer this question,
now familiar strategy.
 You've heard me say many times,
applied.
 Suppose the problem,
 solve, and sees what has to happen.
problem is solved 每 now,
 I want to be careful,
to use the same variables that I use in my notes so I don't confuse the issue,
back and forth between what I'm saying in class and what I say in the notes.
said, suppose the problem's solved?
Fourier transform of F at s.
 And I just play with this.
two spectrums?
 Well, the Fourier transform of G is the integral from -8 to 8.
recourse here but to go to the definition.
 Then -8 to 8 either to the minus 2pi,
 s of t, st,of t, dt.
 And the Fourier transform of F at s is the integral from -
8 to 8.
write this 每 I already used t,
respect to another variable,
 and you'll see why in just a second,
 e to the minus 2pisx,
x, dx. All right,
 I think I can take it from here.
 That's all I wanted to check.
Now, watch this.
 This is the product of two single integrals,
 they are decoupled,
speak. So that is I can write this as one big double integral,
 e to the minus 2pist,
minus 2pisx,
 G of t, F of x, dt, dx. Okay.
 There should be no problem,
to see that.
 And if you're having trouble seeing it,
 instead of going from here to here,
imagine yourself going from here to here.
 The variables are decoupled.
variables are decoupled here,
 I mean they're decoupled.
 I don't know how else to say it.
There's no relationship between the variables; everything happens independently.
 Now,combine the complex exponentials.
 That is, write this,
 integral from -8 to 8,-8 to 8.
 By the way,
 there are issues here.
 I mean,
gonna swap limits of integration,
 I'm gonna swap dtdx,
 dxdt,stuff.
 As I have said before,
 the rigger police are still blessedly off duty.
 All right.is,
 e to the minus 2pi,
 I have a common factor of s in both exponentials,
 and I get a t + x.G of t, F of x, dtdx.
exponentials.
 Now,
 I want to do something a little trickier,
integral as integrated single integrals.
 So now the variables are coupled,
 really.
gonna write this as the integral from -
8 to 8, the inside integral,
 integral from -
8 to 8,the minus 2pis,
 t + x, G of t, dt,
 and then the result is integrated against F of x, dx.
 Now,let's check to make sure that everything's okay here,
end of the day.
On the inside integral I have a function 每 this kernel here involves both,
 well, st and x.
I'm integrating with respect to t.
 So what remains is a function of x,
comes on sort of in the end,
my variables of integration.
 So I've integrated this with the respect to t,
integral.
 What remains is something that depends on x.
 I multiply that by F of x.
integrate with respect to x.
 I'm done, everything's okay.
here is the function of s,
 and that's the product of the Fourier transform.
you expect.
 Now, once again,
 what this calls for,
 if you can only hear it calling,
training your ears and your eyes,
 is a change of variable.
 So I'm gonna let u = t + x,
= dt. See,
 the inside integral is with respect to t,
 so that's the variable here,
 u = dt,then t = u - x.
 So what happens to the inside integral?
 And, again,
 if t goes from -8 to 8,
for any fixed x,
 so does u go from -8 to 8.
 So I get the integral from -
from -8 to 8 of e to the minus 2pis,
 t + x is u, G of t,
 which is u - x,
respect x,
 F of x,
 dx.
 Cool.
 It may seem pointless,
 but it's not.
 Now,order of integration.
 Instead of integrating du,
 dx, I'm gonna integrate dx, du.
gonna write this as the integral from -
8 to 8.from -8 to 8 of G of u - x,
 F of x,
 I'm skipping a step here a little bit,
 but not much,
e to the minus 2pisu, du.
 Is everything okay there?
 Let's check.
 I skipped a step here,
sort of put everything together.
together,
 and then pulled it apart,
 so I have, again,
 the two integrated single integrals.
This integral with respect to x,
 and then what remains 每 again,
respect to x,
 what remains is the function of u.
 I integrate that against this kernel,
complex exponential,
 e to the minus 2pisu,of s.
 Want me to say that again?
 No. All right.
 So I skipped a step there.
integrated integral,
 I could have written everything together,
 grouped everything together,
and then split it up again into to integrated integrals.
 All right.
 Now, look, say,eyes if only we but see.
 This integral inside here is a combination of G and F,
getting integrated against a complex exponential.
 That is, if I now am so bright,
farsighted, if I am so brilliant,
 I will now realize that I have solved my problem.
gonna define h of u to be the integral from -
8 to 8 of G of u -
 x, F of x, dx. Right?
what happened to the inside integral,
 u - x, yeah,
 F of x, dx.
integral from -
8 to 8 of either the minus 2pisu,
 h of u, du,
of h evaluated at s.
Now, once again,
 where do we start?
 Where do we finish?
transform of G at s times the Fourier transform of F at s,
 is the Fourier transform of h at s.
The spectrums multiply if I define h by this formula.
from -
8 to 8 of du - x, F of x, dx.
 I solved my problem.
 Once again,
problem?
 I said is there a way of combining F and G in the time domain,
frequency domain the spectrums multiply,
 the Fourier transforms multiply?
answer is, yes, there is,
 by this complicated integral.
 It's not so obvious.
out of bed in the morning and write this down,
that problem.
 How do we get it? You said,
 suppose the problem is solved,
happen,
 and then we'd have to recognize when it's time to declare victory.
declare victory.
Now, being an obnoxious mathematician,
 you cover your tracks and say,
 "Well,
simply going to define the convolution of two functions by this formula.
different variable here to write the definition down.
 That's how mathematics works,
turn the solution of a problem into a definition.
 It irritates the hell out of some people,
that's how it works.
 So define the convolution of F and G by this formula,
special notations use G * F.
 Well, let me call the variable x here.
-8 to 8, G of x - y, F of y, dy.
 Define the convolution of that?
mathematician,
 you'd say,
 "Well, sure,
 I've defined that.
 What can be more natural.
then you've proved the theorem.
 Then you proved separately,
fact,
transforms.
 But what's missing in that derivation is,
 the game is rigged.
definition was come upon precisely so it would satisfy that property,
transform multiplied the two signals,
 so the Fourier transforms multiply.
Then we have the Fourier transform of the convolution,
G times the Fourier transform F.
 Remarkable.
 But as I said,
 the game's rigged.
 I mean,set out to solve that problem,
 and I solved that problem,
tracks by saying,
 "Well, define the convolution by this,
convolution theorem,
Fourier transform.
" But of course you do because you set it up that way.
Now,
 I don't want it to seem like we've done something insignificant here,
something extremely significant.
multiplying the Fourier transforms is a very powerful thing to be able to do.
this says is,
obvious thing.
 It's a nice enough looking formula,
 it's sort of an elegant looking formula,
but it's not obvious that this would work.
time domain,
 in the frequency domain the Fourier transforms multiply.
 How cool is that.
All right.
 And I think on that note of coolness,
 we'll wrap it up for today,
your everyday lives.
 See you then.
