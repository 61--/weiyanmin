TheFourierTransformAndItsApplications-
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Okay, ready to rock and roll?
 All right.lot of 每 as I understand it,
where to turn in the homework.
 You can certainly bring it to class,
 and that＊s fine.
But if you find yourself wanting to fill in those last minute comments,
the policy is the homework should be due by 5:
00 on Wednesday,
to the magic filing cabinet.
 Across from my office 每 my office is 271 Packard,
a little hallway sort of across from there,
 and there are several gray filing cabinets,
which has my name and the course number on it.
And if you open that drawer,
says something like,
 ※Turn in homework here.
there, okay. So by 5:
00 today the first problem assignment is due.
 All right.questions?
 Anything on anybody＊s mind?
Okay, all right.
 Anything else that came up that I should address?
 No, okay. All right.Today,
 I wanna finish off our discussion Fourier series.
for some of the other things that we do.
solve the heat equation.
the Fourier transform,
study of non-
periodic phenomenon,
concerned with,
 by means of limiting process,
 all right.up.
But first,
 let me go back to the discussion we started last time about the heat equation.
this is the use of Fourier.
 This a classic example,
 the classic example one might say,
Fourier series,
 and also shows in a particular case,
seeing constantly throughout the course.
talk about it.
So this is your Fourier series to solve the heat equation,
equation.
 And I＊ll remind you what the setup is.
 We have a ring,
like that with an initial temperature distribution of 每 we＊re calling F of X.
temperature 每 so I＊m thinking of X here as a spacial variable.
I wanted to mention a special variable,
 although the ring is sitting in two dimensions.
can think of the ring,
 if I want,identified.
At any rate,space,
 since the ring goes round and round and round,
function of the spacial variable,
 the position on the ring.
assume the period is one,
 all right.
 So that＊s how Fourier series comes into the picture.
So we take F to be periodic of period one.
 Then we let the U of XT 每 now,
temperature is varying,
 both in position and in time.
in time,
 and the temperature is different at different points along the ring.
So I let U of XT be the temperature at a position X at time T.
it＊s a periodic function in this spacial variable.
 U is a periodic function of X.
periodic in X.
time.
 When T is fixed,
 this periodic is a function of X.
And the physical situation is described by the heat equation,
the defusion equation,
something through something else [inaudible].
a wire is governed by this sort of equation.
 I mentioned these last time,
semiconductor.
 It really has quite a variety of applications.
And some of the techniques that we＊re talking about here,
this case,
 can be applied in various forms to many different situations.

So it says UT is equal to one-
half UXX.

constant is one-half just to simplify the calculations.
respect to time,
 and this is the second derivative with respect to X.
All right,
 now because the function is periodic in X,
 we can expand it as a Fourier series.
So the rigger police are off duty.
no question about writing down the sums.
gonna do can be justified under reasonable assumptions,
 but that＊s not the point.
point is just to see how the techniques can be used to solve the equation.
So I can write the function as a Fourier series.
 Now remember,X,
 so the [inaudible] on T is on the coefficient.
 K one from minus infinity to infinity,
that＊s 每 I＊ll call it C＊s of K of T times the periodic term,
 either the two pi IKX,
assuming period one.
 That＊s the basic assumption.
 Or rather, that falls from periodicity.
You can expand it as a Fourier series.
 That＊s how Fourier series get into the picture.
Then you plug into the equation 每 we did this last time.
setup.
differential equation for the C＊s.
 The C＊s are the unknowns there.
So the 每 you get this equation,
 you get CK prime of T is equal to minus two pi squared,
squared,
 times CK of T.
 That＊s a simple ordinary differential equation,
to solve it.
 That＊s a simple [inaudible].
the minus two pi squared,
 K squared T.
 That＊s easy. That is easy.
think we got to last time.
Now, what is the initial condition?
 I haven＊t brought in the initial temperature here,
here＊s where it comes in.
 So what is CK of zero?
 All right,
 CK depends on time.
the initial condition?
Well, we can see it,
 actually. Remember,
 UK 每 excuse me,
equals minus infinity to infinity.
 CK of T times E to the two pi I,
 KX.
T equals zero?
 T equals zero,
 this is the initial temperature distribution.
 U at X,
position on the ring,
 at times zero is F of X.
 You give it some initial distribution of heat.
So that says that F of X is U of X zero.
 That＊s the sum from 每 if I plug into the series,
sum from minus infinity to infinity of CK of zero,
 E to the two pi IKX.
Now, we have eyes,
 but if only we but see.
 What does this say?
 F is a periodic function.
This is an expansion of F in terms of the harmonics,
give you the two pi IKX.
 What are the coefficients of C,
T in terms of F?
 What is CK in terms of F,
 CK of zero in terms of F?
Student:
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Pardon me?
 It＊s a Fourier coefficient of F.
Fourier series of F.
 That is to say,
 i.
e.
 CK of zero is just the K Fourier coefficient of F,
out of K.
Now, as they say,
 we have eyes, if only we but see.
statement is you have to be able to go from the function to the series,
be able to go from the series to the function.
Here＊s the function,
 here＊s the series.
for a function,

You＊re used to having problems like here＊s the function,
coefficients.
 All right. Well,here,
 so relate them to the function.
 Let＊s write that down.
That is 每 when I say write that down,
 what I mean is what does the solution look like.
U of XT,
 the temperature 每 this is already very impressive.
at any position X on the circle is F out of K times E to the minus two pi squared,

and the dependence on X.

conclusions from this.
 Namely,temperature?
 It goes to zero.
 As T tends to infinity,
 this term is damping out.
Now see,
 there＊s a cute little thing to observe here.
 This is an exponential,
minus two pi square,
 K square T. Now,
 K is going from minus infinity to infinity,
right.
 K is both positive and negative here.
 But K appears here squared,
always positive.
 So this,

 K square,

 so minus it is always negative.

 all right.
That＊s a little sort of check on consistency there.
observation.
 As T tends to infinity,
 U of XT tends to zero for any value of X.
is cooling off eventually.
Now, this is perfectly fine.
 Actually,
for reasons which I will explain,
course.
 I wanna work with this a little bit more,
different form.
 This was exactly the sort of thing I had you do in homework.
 Although,
homework it turned out even a little bit simpler than this.
 It may not have seemed it,
did.
I wanna write this sum differently.
 I mean, again,T.
 All I＊m saying is there＊s an alternate way of writing it that itself is very revealing,
in fact,
 has consequences that go beyond the particular problem that we＊re studying.
So to do that,
 I wanna bring back the formula for the actual 每 for the Fourier coefficient.
On the right,
 F hat of K.
 I wanna use the explicit formula as an interval.
here,
 so the variable for integration I＊m gonna 每 I＊ll use something else,
I＊ll just use Y.
 It doesn＊t matter what I call it,
 as long as I＊m consistent.
So I＊ll write this as E to the minus two pi IKY,
 F of YDY.
 All right.
for the K Fourier coefficient.
 And plug that into the formula for the solution.
So I get U of XT is the sum,
 and from K 每 from minus infinity to infinity,

And I＊m gonna combine terms and swap the interval and the sum.
 Again,police are off duty,
do with impunity.
Mathematicians can do it with impunity also,
courses before they really feel good about it.
 We don＊t have the time for that.
So this is 每 I＊m gonna swap the interval and the sum,
one of the sum K,
 going from minus infinity to infinity.
together like this; E to the minus two pi IKY,
 E to the two pi IKX,
putting all the terms together that get summed.
 E to the minus two pi squared,T.
 Those terms all get summed,
 and then what stays on the outside is F of YDY.

 I＊ve just rearranged things.

And I＊ll do one more step,
 and that＊s the interval from zero to one,
got I＊s in them.
 E to the to pi IKX minus Y,
 E to the minus two pi squared,
 K squared T,
F of YDY.
Like I said,
 I haven＊t done anything really,
 except rearrange terms.
this way because I know what＊s gonna happen,
 or rather,finally.
That is F sum deserves to be singled out for special attention,
own special name.
 So I＊m gonna write,
 say, G of XT to be this sum.
infinity to infinity,
 E to the two pi IX,
 E to the minus two pi squared,
 K squared T.
This is actually G of X minus Y,
 T.
 That is the interval.
 The solution appears in this form.
Pardon me?
Student:
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
KX, thank you.
 Two pi IKX.
So the solution U appears in the following form.
 I just use that as a shorthand notation.
The solution looks like this; U of XT is the interval from zero to one,
 G of X minus Y,
 T,
F of YDY.
 And that＊s all I wanna 每 that＊s the 每 I＊m not gonna do anything else.

 I won＊t do any more rearranging; I won＊t do anymore fiddling around.
I＊m gonna write the solution.
Now,
 for those of you who＊ve seen this,
sort of thing on the homework problem.
that I＊m about to make.
 Drum roll.
 This expresses the solution,
this kernel.
This expresses UXT as the convolution of F of X,
 F of Y, it doesn＊t matter,
what＊s called the heat kernel G of XT.

 although you may have heard in different context the term convolution,
which we are gonna be hearing all the time.
 And in this special case,
heat kernel.

So I will just 每 without saying really anything more,
terminology,
 you call G of XT 每 has a variety of names.
 That function that I wrote down,
G of XT,
 is called variously the heat kernel.
 That is it＊s a kernel for the heat equation.
convolution like this.
Heat kernel is also called the fundamental solution of a heat equation,
Green＊s function for the heat equation.
Now, let me just ask,
 just to take a survey out there.

 so a couple people,

 I＊m just curious.
Student:
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Oh,
 is that right? Okay.
 And they did it more or less like this?
Student:
Pretty similar.
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Yeah.
 They probably worried about certain things,
convergence and things like that,
 right, but screw them.
And how about this terminology?
 So have you heard this terminology,
 the heat kernel,
the fundamental solution or the Green＊s function?
Green＊s function for differential equations and things like that.
 You may have seen that.
And we＊re not gonna 每 I＊m not gonna make a big deal out of it,
 but again,see everywhere.
For us,

 And it is the kind of thing that comes up.

 and the special functions associated with the equation.

 it should not surprise you to see convolution coming into the picture somehow.
This is an example of that.
On the homework you had another example of it.
celebrated problem in mathematical physics,
 the so-
called [inaudible] problem,
again,
 the solution ultimately could be written as convolutions.
There,
 the nice thing was that you actually got a closed-

 or the fundamental solution for that problem.
actually a closed-
form expression.
 There＊s no similar closed-
form expression here,
can＊t do anything more with this function.
 It is what it is.
 It＊s just this infinite sum.
For the problem you had in homework,
 again,
 you get an infinite sum that comes in,
collapses because it＊s a geometric series.
 And you get a nice closed-

But in principle,

 you＊ll 每 it＊s sort of a fact that took a long time to sort out,

 It＊s something you should expect to see.
This is a pretty big major secret of the universe,
 all right.
 So take that to heart,
this.
 Be afraid, be very afraid.
 No, no, show no fear.
 It＊s what you should expect.
And with that 每 pretty impressive.
 And as I say,heritage, all right.
 You should know this solution,
 know this approach to the problem.
a very famous problem.
 It had all sorts of far reaching consequences.
your soul.
I believe with that we bid adieu to Fourier series,
from time to time.
 And actually,
Fourier transforms.
And that is the transition from periodic phenomenon to non-
periodic phenomenon.
wanna make a transition from Fourier series to Fourier transforms.
transition from periodic phenomenon to non-
periodic phenomenon.
Now, I＊ve said before,
 and you＊ll hear me say it again,

 and choices for how to cover the material.

In many treatments of the Fourier transform,

 That is,Fourier transforms.

 That＊s fine, and that＊s quite justifiable.
with periodicity.
 It＊s an important enough topic,
those things 每 I wanted to try to cultivate your intuition a little bit for those sorts of ideas.
But you don＊t have to do it this way.
If you＊ll look at Bracewell＊s book,
used for this course 每 Ron Bracewell just passed away,
 actually,

 many years.

 with no mention of Fourier series.
 And then later on,
recovers some of the ideas of Fourier series based on the Fourier transform.
do that, but that＊s a choice,
 and I have made a different choice.
here.
Now, the transition from periodic to non-
accomplish that is to view a non-
phenomenon as the period tends to infinity,
 all right.
So we＊ll do this by viewing non-
periodic function,
 and we＊ll say phenomena.
 So non-the period tends to infinity,
 period tends to infinity.
It＊s a little tricky to do this, actually.
automatically.
 It takes a little work.
 It＊s not a completely automatic process.
Now,
actually two aspects to this.
 So once again,
Fourier series case.
 There are two aspects to the Fourier transform,
 really.
 Two aspects,
there＊s analysis and synthesis.
So the analysis is the Fourier series is forming 每 so again,
 if F of T is periodic,
have the Fourier coefficients,
 the interval from zero to one,
 E to the minus two pi IKX,
of RKT, F of TDT.
 That＊s analysis.
 That＊s analyzing the function,
constituent components.
the whole by this much,
 this amount.
Then there＊s synthesis.
 The synthesis is writing the series.

a signal into its constituent parts.
The inverse Fourier transform is a generalization,
 or the limited case in the Fourier series.
It is a limiting case of a Fourier series.
 That＊s the synthesis part of the equation,
part of the discussion.
Now,
 so how do I set this up in order to take a limit?
limiting case is the period tends to infinity,
Fourier series,
 for Fourier coefficients and for Fourier series,
 when the period is not one,
but the period is some other number,
 capital T,
 that I can let tend to infinity.
So we need a setup when say F of T is periodic of period T.
to infinity.
 I want to let T tend to infinity.
 How do I do this?Well,
 you read about this,
 I hope, I expect.
 Let me tell you what the formulas are.
hard.
 The building blocks for a signal of period T are complex exponentials of period T,
so that＊s E to the two pi IKT over T.
Or I＊m actually gonna write it a little bit differently.
ITK over T.
 It doesn＊t matter.
 I just switched the parenthesis there.
 Same thing.
These are periodic of period capital T.
series are the form CKK going from minus infinity to infinity,
 C, sum K,IKX 每 KT 每 K 每 [inaudible] write like this.
 K over TT,
 or K little T over capital T.
gonna write it like that for reasons you＊ll see in just a second.
series looks like.
What are the coefficients?
 Well,
 again,
we were working with functions of period one,
the period one case to derive a general result.
At any rate,
 what you find is C sub K is given by one over T,
to T of either the minus two pi IK over T,
 little T,
 F of T,
 DT.
that F is little,
 F is periodic of period T?
 I guess I didn＊t say that,
 so sorry,
now.
 F of T here is a given signal,
 so I＊m assuming it is periodic of period capital T.
of T,
 periodic of period capital T.
That＊s the formula the K Fourier coefficient when the function has period capital T.
actually,
 you use this again in the homework problem.
Okay.
 Now,
 one other thing,
tends to infinity.
 I can also write this the function＊s periodic of period T,
what interval you integrate over.
If I know the function on an interval of length T I know it everywhere,
this formula 每 and again,
also write the formula as instead of integrating from zero to T,
T over two,
 to T over two as symmetric interval from negative to positive.
 Same thing,
either the minus two pi IK over capital T, T, F of TDT.
 Okay, fine.
Now,
 this is really no different than what I＊ve done before,
little bit more generally.
 Instead of a function of period one,
one,
 I have a function of period capital T.
But the formula for the Fourier coefficient is perfectly [inaudible] to what I had before,
and the formula for the Fourier series is perfectly [inaudible] to what I had before.
again, that＊s analysis,
 that＊s synthesis.
 You analysis the function into its constituent parts,
and then you synthesis it by forming the corresponding sum.
Now,
 I wanna point something out here that＊s very interesting.
picture of the spectrum of these cases?
 What＊s a picture of these things?
of the spectrum,
 picture in the frequency side,
 picture of the spectrum of frequencies?
Well, in the case of period one 每 let＊s take period one.
given by the usual formula we had before,
 and you might draw the spectrum like this.
There＊s a coefficient of zero,
 that＊s the zero coefficient,
 C zero.
 Then there＊s the 每 well,
let＊s see.
Zero, one, two.
 I have frequencies at all the integers.
 Minus one, minus two,and so on.
 Three, minus three.
 And there＊s space,
 so to speak,
 the harmonics,
frequencies of space are one apart.
 Here is like absolute value of C zero.
value of C one.
 Here＊s 每 I say absolute value because they＊re actually complex numbers.
The coefficients are complex numbers,
 so I can＊t actually plot them.
But I can plot 每 I can get a picture of the spectrum by plotting the absolute value.
the absolute value of C two,
 and here＊s the absolute value of C three,
 whatever it is.
And what will I get on the negative side,
 what will I get on the negative side?
negative side I get the same absolute values because of the symmetry relation,
is equal to CK bar.
is the magnitude of CK bar,
same thing as the magnitude of the number.
 So this is also the magnitude of CK.
The picture＊s the same on the left,
 so this is the magnitude of C minus one,
of C minus two,
 the magnitude of C three, whatever.
 Magnitude of C minus three,
whatever it looks like.
 That＊s the picture.
And in fact,
 if you＊ve ever worked with a spectrum analyzer,
gonna bring one into class,
 you see pictures like this.
bars that are at the different frequencies,
 okay.Now,
 the important thing here is 每 the reason I mentioned this is they＊re spaced one apart.
Because a period one 每 the frequencies are also one apart,
 one, two, three,so on.
Now, what about for a function of period T?
frequencies is one.
 The spacing of the frequencies is one.
gonna draw the pictures.
Now, what about if you had period T?
 What about if I had period T?
 Well,picture there?
 The picture is like this,
for a function of period T looks like the sum from minus infinity to infinity,
 C sub K,the two pi I,
 K over T times T.
So the harmonics,
 they＊re indexed by K,
 but they＊re periodic of period T,
 so really,
harmonic you＊re interested in is in some sense tagged by K over capital T.
 So zero,
over T, two over T, three over T,
 minus one over T, minus two over T,T,
 and so on.
looked like this,
a zero,
 so this is now period 每 so this is for period one.
For period T,
 you would draw the first harmonic sort of at one over T,
harmonic is two over T,
 the third harmonic is three over T,
 and so on and so on.
Then this minus one over T,
 minus two over T and so on,
 the spacing is one over T apart.
And here＊s the zero Fourier coefficient,
 here＊s the first Fourier coefficient,
second Fourier coefficient,
 here＊s the third Fourier coefficient.
每 corresponding the negative frequencies have the same 每 when I say here＊s the first,
here＊s the second,
 here＊s the third,
 I mean the magnitude because again,
complex numbers.
 You＊re just plotting the magnitude.
And on the left,
 I have the same picture because it＊s symmetric.
 So it＊s like this,
 like this,
like that and so on.
 Minus three over T and so on.
 They＊re spaced one over T apart.
the spectrum has spacing one over T.
Now,and wavelength,
 and I talked about the inverse relationship,
between frequency and wavelength,
 very first day of class.
long time ago.
This is our second related example of an inverse or reciprocal relationship between,
this case,
 I＊m gonna say the two domains.
 How the function appears in the time domain,
and how the function appears in the frequency domain.
 How this is a function of time,
and how it is in terms of its constituent frequency parts.
If the period is T,
 then the spacing and the frequencies is one over T.
relationship here between the period and the frequencies.
often 每 and what＊s happening to the function in time,
the time domain of the function,
frequencies.
Or viewing the function in the frequency domain,
parts.over T. Frequency spaced one over T apart.
All right.
 I didn＊t say anything about the size of T here,
relationship between the two domains.
 And again,
throughout this course.
 So a reciprocal relationship between the two view of the function.
And that reciprocity is exactly mediated by Fourier techniques,
 Fourier series in this case,
or very soon the Fourier transform.
But again,
 it＊s the kinda thing 每 this is the sort of intuition you have to start to develop.
You＊re viewing the function one way,
 you expect certain things.
the other domain you expect the reciprocal phenomenon.
Now,
 if T is less than one,
 and one over T is bigger than one,
 so T less than one.
spacing than one,
 implies one over T is bigger than one,
 so the spacing is larger.
每 one over T is bigger than one,
 spacing bigger than zero,
 bigger than one.
The spectrum is spread out.
 If T is bigger than one,
 if you have a long period,
spectrum is compressed.
 The spacing is one over T.
 One over T is less than one,
spacing in the spectrum is squeezed,
 compressed.
In particular,
 as T is going 每 as capital T is going to infinity,
I wanna deal with,
smaller and smaller.
 The frequencies are getting closer and closer together.
 One over T,
two over T,
 three over T,
 four over T.
 They＊re getting closer and closer.
getting smaller and smaller,
 and they＊re getting closer together.
 As T tends to infinity,
spectrum becomes sort of continuous.
I＊m gonna make this more precise,
 or rather,
more precise in just a minute.
 But the idea is the spectrum＊s getting closer,
T.
 The spacing is one over T,
 and if T is tending to infinity,
 the spacing is tending to zero.
That＊s what I mean by the fact that the spectrum is getting continuous,
getting squeezed.
 Now,
 that＊s the formula here for the coefficient here once again.
Now, let me just start now 每 no,
 one thing at a time.
 So let me 每 once again,
down the formula for the coefficient.
 CK is one over T.

 and use this to pass from periodic to non-

But as I say,
 it＊s not quite straightforward.
 And let me tell you why.

 You can＊t just let T tend to infinity and get the Fourier transform.
have to tickle it a little bit.
And actually,
 let me leave this picture up on the board and show over here,
 all right.
me tell you what the setup is gonna be and what I wanna do.
So imagine I have some function.
 The picture＊s not periodic.
 But suppose it＊s fine,
extend.
 So suppose F of T looks like this.
 Sum [inaudible] sum,

 and it＊s zero beyond 每 less than A and bigger than B,
 all right.
function.
So I take some big number, T,
 and I periodize this,
two is less than A,
 and plus T over two is bigger than B.
 So here＊s my function; it＊s zero,
less than A,
 it＊s zero, bigger than B.
 I take some 每 and I wanna approximate this thing,
but I wanna imagine this is a periodic function.
the function is zero,
 and I periodize it to be period T,
 all right.
to have period T.
Okay, fine. Now,
 write down the formula for the Fourier coefficient.
 So imagine,
function here were fixed,
 if that＊s all I worried about,
 I let T go to infinity,
of approximating that non-
big period, all right.
 That＊s gonna be my goal.
But the problem is 每 and I wanna see what happens to the Fourier coefficient.
down C sub K.
 The Fourier coefficient looks like this,
 C sub K is one over T,
from minus T over two to T over two,
 E to the minus two pi I,
 K over T, little T, F of T,DT,
 okay.
 That＊s the K Fourier coefficient.
But now,
 F is zero,
 less than A and bigger than B,
 and those numbers are fixed.
sort of given to us.
 So this is equal to one over T times the interval from A to B.
minus two pi I,
 K over T, little T, F of T, BT.
 Because the function F,
 I＊m assuming,
zero, less than A and bigger than B, okay.
Now,
 this interval in absolute value is gonna be bounded.
 The interval from A to B,
the minus 每 an absolute value 每 E to the minus two pi I,
 K over T, little T, F of T, DT,
absolute value is less than the interval and the absolute value.
the interval from A to B,
exponential,
 which is one,
 times the function DT.
exponential is one.
 I＊m almost there,
 almost there.
So this is just equal to the interval,
 this absolute value.
just a second,
 really, really, really.
 This is equal to the interval from A to B,
 F of T,
because the absolute value of the complex exponential is just one.
 That＊s a fixed number.
It＊s like M.
Okay.
 So what does that say about the Fourier coefficient?
 Watch what I did here.
wrote down the formula for the K Fourier coefficient.
convince you there＊s a little bit of problem with directly letting T tend to infinity.
directly let T tend to infinity,
 everything is gonna die.
Here＊s the K Fourier coefficient.
 It＊s one over T times this interval.
interval?
 That interval is that interval,
goodbye to this drawing now.
So this says that in absolute value,
all K, all right.
 So as T tends to infinity,
 C sub K tends to zero.
die.
So I had this wonderful idea.
 I said I＊m gonna approximate a non-
by a periodic phenomena,
 a very large period,
infinity.
 Sounds great.
 Sounds like a very natural thing to do.
I write down the formula for the Fourier series,
 great.
Fourier series, great.
 I＊m gonna let T tend to infinity, great.
tend to zero, not great.
infinity. Not great.
I think I have to quit right now.
 Tomorrow, on Friday,
very nice, easy way that＊s gonna lead to everything.
