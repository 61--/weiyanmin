1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,277
All right. So today,

2
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,687
 I wanna continue our study and begin a real每

3
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:36,799
 serious mathematical study of the question of periodicity.

4
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,997
Remember that we are essentially identifying the subject of Fourier series with the study每

5
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:44,838
 with the mathematical study of periodicity.

6
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:50,064
And last time I went on, at some length,about the virtues of periodicity,

7
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,408
about the ubiquitous nature of periodic functions 每

8
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:54,833
periodic phenomena in the physical world,

9
00:00:54,833 --> 00:01:02,756
and also in the mathematical world.And we made a distinction,

10
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:03,608
perhaps a little bit artificial but sometimes helpful,

11
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,758
between periodicity in time and periodicity in space.

12
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:09,085
Those sort of two phenomena seem to be,or often come to you in different forms,

13
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:13,773
and it＊s sometimes useful in your own headto sort of ask yourself which kind of periodicity are you looking at?

14
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,811
But in all cases actually,

15
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:19,168
periodicity is associated with the idea of symmetry.

16
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,863
That＊s the topic that will come up from time to time,

17
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,022
and if I don＊t mention it explicitly,

18
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:25,549
as with many other things in this course,

19
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,502
it＊s one of the things that you should learn to sort of react to or think about yourself每

20
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:32,953
 see what aspects of symmetry are coming up in the problem,

21
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:36,819
how does a particular problem fit into a more general context because,

22
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,551
as I＊ve said before and will say it again,

23
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,060
one of the wonderful things about this subject is the way it all hangs togetherand 

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,963
how it can be applied in so many different ways.

25
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,440
All right.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,771
If you understand the general framework and put yourself每

27
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:51,410
 and orient yourself in a certain way,

28
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,326
using the ideas and the techniques of the class,

29
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,339
you＊ll really find how remarkably applicable they can be.

30
00:01:54,339 --> 00:02:02,908
Okay. So I said 每 as I said last time 每as we finished up last time,

31
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:06,586
when we＊re sort of still just crawling our way out of junior high,

32
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:09,449
a mathematical course of periodicity is possiblebecause 

33
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,551
there are very simple mathematical functions that exhibit periodic behavior,

34
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,477
namely the sine and the cosine.

35
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:18,629
But that＊s also the problem because periodic phenomena can be very general and very complicated,

36
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,109
and the sine and the cosine are so simple.

37
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,105
So how can you really expect to use the sine and the cosine

38
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:27,270
 to model very general periodic phenomena?

39
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,793
And that＊s really the question I want to address today.

40
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:35,451
So how could we use such simple functions 每

41
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:43,153
sine of t and cosine of t每 to model complex periodic phenomena?

42
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:58,599
Now, first, the general remark is,how high should we aim here?

43
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,600
I mean, how general can we expect this to be?

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,299
So how general? All right.

45
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,136
That＊s really the fundamental question here.

46
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,251
And in answering that question,

47
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:19,366
led both scientists and mathematicians very far from the original areathat they were investigating.

48
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:25,215
Let me say 每 well, let me say right now, pretty general,

49
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:28,526
 all right.And we＊ll see exactly how general 每

50
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:33,225
I＊ll try to make that more precise as we develop a little bit more of the terminology thatreally 每

51
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,625
 that will apply and allow us to get more careful statements.

52
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,797
But we＊re really aiming quite high here,all right?

53
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:43,356
And we＊re really hoping to apply these ideas in quite general circumstances.

54
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,631
Now, not all phenomena are periodic.All right.

55
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:51,016
 And even in the case of periodic phenomena,

56
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,065
it may not be a realistic assumption.

57
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,141
 I think that＊s importantto realize here what the limits may be,

58
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:59,924
 or how far the limits can be pushed. So not allphenomena,

59
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:05,612
 naturally, although many are, and many interesting ones are periodic.

60
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,119
 Andeven periodic phenomena, in some sense,

61
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:14,650
 you＊re making an assumption there that is notreally physically realizable.

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,688
 So even for periodic phenomena or at least functions that areperiodic in time,

63
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:23,307
 even phenomena 每

64
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:26,258
 soon I think I＊ll start talking in terms of signalsrather than phenomena,

65
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,516
 but phenomena sounds a little grander at this point.

66
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:36,868
 Evenphenomena that are periodic in time 每

67
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:43,390
 real phenomena, they just die out eventually.

68
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,087
 Weonly observe 每

69
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,399
 or at least we only observe something over a finite period of time,

70
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,940
whereas, as mathematical functions, the sine and the cosine go on forever.

71
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,807
 All right. As amathematical model, sine and cosine go on forever.

72
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:57,757
 So how can they really be used tomodel to something that dies out?

73
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:04,106
 But a periodic function, sine and cosine 每

74
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:15,107
 all right 每 goon forever, repeating over and over again.

75
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:15,628
 All right.

76
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:21,201
 So in what sense can you really usesines and cosines to model periodic phenomena when a real periodic phenomena 每

77
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:24,464
 whenit really dies out? Well,

78
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,794
 that＊ll take us awhile to sort all that out.

79
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,516
 Let me just give you oneanswer to this,

80
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:29,562
 and one indication of how general these ideas really are.

81
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,675
 And you have ahomework problem that asks you actually to address this mathematically.

82
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:37,052
 All right. So ifyou have a finite 每 you can still use 每

83
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:43,510
 still apply ideas of periodicity,

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,173
 even if only as anapproximation or even if only as an extra assumption.

85
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:53,840
 So what I mean by that is, asfollows. So suppose a phenomena looks like this.

86
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,763
 Suppose the signal looks like 每something like this 每

87
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:07,827
 let me write it over here. So it dies out over a period of time.

88
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:10,091
 So thisis time and there＊s only a finite interval of time 每

89
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:13,121
 it might be very large,

90
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:13,939
 but there＊s only afinite interval of time when the signal is non-

91
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,084
zero. I＊m drawing just as a 每 somehowgeneric signal here.

92
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:20,061
 Well, that＊s not a periodic phenomena; it doesn＊t exhibit periodicbehavior.

93
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:24,309
 But if it dies after a finite 每 outside of a finite interval,

94
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:29,188
 then you can just repeatthe pattern and make it periodic.

95
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:34,778
 All right. Force this 每 you can force periodicity.

96
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:47,453
 That is,by repeating the pattern. You can force extra symmetry.

97
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:50,144
 You can force extra structure tothe problem that＊s not there in the beginning.

98
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:54,743
 So, I mean by this a very simple idea.Here＊s the original signal,

99
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:59,316
 and I just repeat the pattern. So this is the original signal,

100
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:01,205
 theseare maybe, sort of, you know,

101
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:07,864
 extra copies of it that I＊m just inserting artificially,

102
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,606
 andextend the function to be periodic and exist for all time.

103
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:13,444
 You may only be interested inthis part of it,

104
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,735
 but for mathematical analysis, if you make it periodic,

105
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,840
 that＊ll apply to thewhole thing. All right.

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:26,853
 This is sometimes called the periodization of a signal.

107
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:31,109
 And it canbe used 每 and it is used 每 to study signals which are non-

108
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,883
periodic to 每 excuse me 每 to usemethods of Fourier series,

109
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:36,718
 and pumpkins is another sort of Fourier analysis to studysignals which are not periodic.

110
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:40,227
 So there＊s actually a homework problem on different sortsof periodization,

111
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:44,517
 and it＊s a technique that comes up in various applications.

112
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:48,905
 All right. Sosee the first problem set, homework one.

113
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:49,454
 Now,

114
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:57,733
 the point is that periodicity and thetechniques for studying periodic phenomena are really pretty general.

115
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:58,725
 All right.

116
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,344
 Even ifyou don＊t have a periodic phenomenon,

117
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:01,529
 you can make it periodic,

118
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:05,455
 and perhaps you couldapply the techniques to study the periodized version of it,

119
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:06,570
 and then restrict 每

120
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,874
 study thespecial cases of actually where you＊re interested in the function.

121
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:11,851
 All right. So it＊s pretty 每that＊s the point of this remark,

122
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:13,257
 is that the phenomena 每

123
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:19,387
 that you＊re not restricting yourselfso much by insisting that you＊re gonna use sines and cosines,

124
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:26,248
 or you＊re gonna studyperiodic phenomena.

125
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:35,161
 So the study that we＊re gonna make here can be pretty general 每

126
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:38,227
 itcan apply really quite generally. Okay.

127
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:43,139
 Now, let＊s do it. Or let＊s get launched into theprogram.

128
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,255
 So, first of all, let＊s fix a period in the discussion.

129
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:51,285
 All right. So we just 每 just tospecialize and fix ideas,

130
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:52,922
 let＊s take 每

131
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:56,742
 let＊s consider periodic phenomena of a given fixedperiod and see what we can say about those;

132
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,447
 see how we can model thosemathematically.

133
00:08:58,447 --> 00:08:59,777
 So for the discussion,

134
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:06,929
 let＊s fix the period for the discussion.

135
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,657
 All right.And there＊s a choice here.

136
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:13,638
 A natural choice would be too high because the sine and thecosine are naturally periodic of period two pi,

137
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:17,926
 but I think for many formulas and for 每 andfor a variety of reasons,

138
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,228
 it is more convenient to fix the period to be one.

139
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,670
 All right. Sowe＊re gonna look 每 we＊re gonna consider function signals,

140
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,931
 which are periodic of periodone. So we＊ll use period one.

141
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:35,777
 That is, we consider signals 每 I＊ll write things as a functionof time,

142
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:36,352
 but again,

143
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:38,675
 it＊s not only periodicity and time that I＊m considering.

144
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,193
 All that I＊mgonna say can apply to any sort of periodic phenomena,

145
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:49,043
 so we＊ll consider functions f of tsatisfying 每

146
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:55,822
 f of t plus one is equal to f of t for all t.

147
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:56,395
 All right.

148
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,451
 And as the building blocksas the basic model functions,

149
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:02,151
 we scale the sine and the cosine, that is,

150
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,870
 we don＊t just lookat sine of t and cosine of t,

151
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,046
 we look at sine of two pi t and cosine of two pi t.

152
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:17,962
 So the modelsignals are sine of two pi t,

153
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:21,653
 that has period one, and cosine of two pi t,

154
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:26,676
 that has periodone. All right. Simple enough.

155
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:29,399
 Now,

156
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,846
 one very important thing I wanna comment before 每

157
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:34,493
before we launch into particulars,

158
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,484
 is that periodicity is a strong assumption,

159
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:42,547
 and theanalysis of periodicity has a lot of consequences.

160
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,444
 If you know 每 if you have a periodicfunction 每

161
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,251
 if you know it on an interval of length one,

162
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,037
 and any interval of length one,

163
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:49,936
 youknow it everywhere because the pattern repeats.

164
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:53,155
 If you just know a piece of the function,

165
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,826
you know it everywhere. So if we know 每 if we know,

166
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:58,803
 and I say, if we know 每 if weanalyze, if we 每

167
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:05,289
 whatever formulas we derive, and so on, this is an important maxim.

168
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,110
 SoI＊ll put it in quotes, ※know.§ To be a sort of generic,

169
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:16,701
 infinite, perfect, God-likeknowledge. So if we know a periodic function,

170
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:27,100
 say period one, on an interval, and not justa particular interval,

171
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:47,602
 but any interval of length one, then we know it everywhere.

172
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:51,661
 Allright. These are all simple remarks. Okay.

173
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:54,430
 These are remarks that you all have seenbefore in various contexts,

174
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,749
 but again,

175
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,130
 I wanna lay them out because I want you to havethem in your head.

176
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,766
 And I want you to be able to pull out the appropriate remark atappropriate time.

177
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:10,619
 And you＊d be amazed how far simple remarks can lead in the analysisof really quite complicated phenomena.

178
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,643
 Now, how are we gonna 每

179
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:17,109
 how are we gonnatake such simple functions of sine and cosine individually,

180
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:20,446
 and model very complicatedperiodic phenomena?

181
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:23,018
 That is the sine and the cosine as endlessly fascinating as they maybe,

182
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:31,229
 are just the sine and the cosine. But the fact is,

183
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:39,415
 they can be modified and combined toyield quite general results.

184
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:49,328
 We can modify and combine sine of two pi t,

185
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:53,751
 cosine of two pit,

186
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:59,191
 to model very general periodic phenomena of period one.

187
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:05,593
 Okay. To model generalperiodic signals of,

188
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:11,860
 again, period one. All right. Now, here is the first big idea,

189
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,734
 or here＊s away of phrasing the first big idea.

190
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:16,317
 When I talk about modifying and combining 每

191
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:19,411
 well,let＊s first talk about modifying.

192
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:22,625
 And the maxim or the aphorism that goes on 每

193
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,352
 goes withwhat I have in mind is, one period,

194
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:34,463
 many frequencies. As far as a big idea 每

195
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:44,234
 one period,many frequencies.

196
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:53,512
 I think you can actually find this in The Dead Sea Scrolls.

197
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:58,375
 Okay. Whatdo I mean, one period, many frequencies?

198
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:04,862
 Well, let me just take a simple example.

199
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:13,334
 Imean, for example, e.g., you have sine of two pi t,

200
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:17,755
 and we know what the graph of thatlooks like.

201
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,148
 I＊ll put the graphs over here. It repeats once and it has 每

202
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:23,523
 it＊s a period one; italso has a frequency one that is 每

203
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,554
 completes one cycle in one second. So if I think of thisas the time axis,

204
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:29,460
 say, although, again, I＊m thinking in terms of time,

205
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,490
 it＊s a very generalmathematical statement.

206
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,032
 It repeats exactly once on the interval from zero to one.

207
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:37,309
 Allright.

208
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,696
 If I double the frequency and look at sine four pi t 每

209
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,404
 all right 每 then that completestwo cycles.

210
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:52,310
 So this is period one, frequency. Sine of four pi t is period one-

211
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,753
half,frequency one 每 frequency two, but period one-

212
00:14:57,753 --> 00:15:05,394
half also means period one. All right. Andthe picture looks like this,

213
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:08,971
 it goes up and down twice 每 [inaudible] 每

214
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:13,619
 it does, in onesecond. All right. Zero, one,

215
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,621
 it repeats. One cycle 每

216
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,910
 it goes through one cycle in a half asecond,

217
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,194
 it goes through two cycles in one second,

218
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:21,526
 so that＊s frequency two. All right.

219
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:27,353
 Butit also has period one because if you consider this as the basic pattern that repeats,

220
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:29,617
 and italso repeats on an interval of length one.

221
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:30,062
 Okay.

222
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,692
 It＊s true that it repeats on an intervallength one-

223
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:32,263
half,

224
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,022
 but the signals already contained in interval one-

225
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:38,552
half, but the whole 每 butthe signal also has a longer period.

226
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,914
 All right. It has a shorter period, but it also has alonger period.

227
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:43,658
 And let me do one more. If, for instance,

228
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:56,247
 I look at sine of six pi t, verysimple. All my remarks are very simple.

229
00:15:56,247 --> 00:16:02,600
 This is period one-third, this has frequencythree,

230
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,035
 but it also has period one. You might think of this as,

231
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,446
 I don＊t know, the secondaryperiod, or somehow 每

232
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:12,397
 I don＊t know what exactly the best way of saying it because,

233
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:12,856
 really,

234
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:15,401
the best description is in terms of frequency not period.

235
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,464
 And what does the picture looklike? Well,

236
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,438
 this time it has three cycles per second 每

237
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,089
 frequency three 每

238
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,620
 so that means itgoes up and down three times in one second.

239
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,333
 Let＊s see if I can possibly do this. One,

240
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:33,654
 two,three. Good enough. One, zero, and one cycle is in one 每

241
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,548
 goes up and down completelyonce in one-third of a second,

242
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:38,226
 then the next third of a second it goes up and down again,

243
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,510
the next third of a second it goes up and down a third time.

244
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,479
 But it also has period onebecause if you consider this has the pattern that repeats,

245
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:48,654
 that pattern repeats on an intervalof length one.

246
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:52,797
 Although, in some sense, the true repetition 每

247
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:54,020
 the true period is shorter thanthat. Now,

248
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,170
 what about combining them? So that＊s how you can modify 每

249
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,146
 and you can dothe same thing with cosine.

250
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,357
 That＊s how you modify the function 每 one period,

251
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:04,618
 manyfrequencies. If we combine them together,

252
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:08,474
 I actually have a picture of it here, but I thinkI＊ll just try to sketch it 每

253
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:16,070
 fool that I am. What about the combination?

254
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,896
 And when I saycombination, I am thinking of a simple sum.

255
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:25,122
 That is sine of two pi t plus sine of six pi t 每

256
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:26,770
excuse me 每

257
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,825
 sine of four pi t plus sine of six pi t.

258
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:38,592
 All right. What does the graph of thatlook like?

259
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:48,827
 Well, it looks like so. And I＊m gonna sketch this,

260
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:50,444
 and then I＊m gonna 每 I＊llmake 每

261
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,662
 I wanna make another comment about this in just a second,

262
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:56,605
 but I actually hadMathematica plot this for me.

263
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:00,095
 It looks something like this, it goes 每

264
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:01,867
 this is plotted on aninterval of length two.

265
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,630
 All right. I＊ve plotted it and it goes 每

266
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,482
 it＊s kinda nice,

267
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:07,448
 it goes up andthen a little bit like this,

268
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:10,225
 and then it goes up and then down a little bit farther,

269
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:13,940
 and up alittle bit like that, and it goes down 每

270
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,272
 that＊s the sound it makes 每 up, down like that,

271
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,417
 andthen up 每 excuse me 每 and that＊s not two,

272
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:27,805
 it will be two, and down and up, and then therewe go.

273
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:30,029
 Two. And then it repeats. Here＊s one. All right.

274
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:32,960
 That＊s the sum. Now, what is theperiod of a sum?

275
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,521
 The period of the sum is one. All right.

276
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,828
 Because although the things of 每

277
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,051
the terms of higher frequency are repeating more rapidly,

278
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:49,169
 the sum can＊t go back to whereit started until the slowest one gets caught up 每

279
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,268
 goes to where 每 back to where it started.

280
00:18:52,268 --> 00:19:01,292
All right. The period of the sum is one. One period,

281
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,220
 many frequencies. There are threefrequencies in the sum.

282
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,927
 One, two, and three. But added together,

283
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,887
 there＊s only one period.So in a complicated 每

284
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:13,090
 this is a very important point, and again,

285
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:20,491
 I＊m sure it＊s a point thatyou＊ve seen before.

286
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:24,930
 That＊s why I say one period, many frequency,

287
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,101
 and that＊s why forcomplicated periodic phenomena,

288
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:30,717
 it＊s really better, more revealing,

289
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:34,424
 to talk in terms of thefrequencies that might go into it,

290
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,500
 rather than the period. You are fixing the period.

291
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,496
 You＊refixing the period to have length one.

292
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:38,702
 All right. But you want 每

293
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,147
 but you might have a verycomplicated phenomena.

294
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,945
 That complicated phenomena, as it turns out,

295
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:47,625
 is gonna be builtup out of sines and cosines of varying frequency.

296
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,888
 AS long as the sum has period one, thenwe＊re okay.

297
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,501
 One period, many frequencies.

298
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:55,759
 That＊s the aphorism that goes on with this 每

299
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,774
that goes along with this. Now, in fact, what is it 每

300
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:05,070
 what we can do more than just modifythe frequency.

301
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,788
 We can also modify the amplitudes separately,

302
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,122
 and we can modify thephases of each one of those 每

303
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:29,381
 each one of those terms. So to model complicated,

304
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:32,493
 perhaps,how complicated? We＊ll see.

305
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:40,858
 A complicated signal of period one we can sum 每

306
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:50,291
 we canmodify the amplitude, the frequency,

307
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,954
 and the phases of either sines or cosines,

308
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,483
 but let mejust stick with the sines 每 of sine of two pi t,

309
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:05,058
 and add up the results. That is, we canconsider something like this.

310
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:17,427
 Something of a form, say, k going from one up to n,

311
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:20,107
 and wecan consider how ever many of them we want.

312
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:24,921
 A sub k, sine of two pi k times t plus 每

313
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:31,443
that＊s modifying the frequency 每 plus fe sub k 每

314
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:36,768
 allowing myself to modify the phase. Fesub k.

315
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:41,362
 That＊s about the most general kind of sum that we can form out of just the sines or每

316
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:42,902
 and I can do the same thing with cosines,

317
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,139
 or I can combine the two and I＊ll say moreabout that in just a second.

318
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:49,198
 All right. So again, many frequencies, one period.

319
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,152
 All right.the lowest 每

320
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:54,135
 the longest period in the sum is when k is equal to one,

321
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:56,979
 period one. Thehigher terms, they＊re called harmonics,

322
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:00,392
 because of the connection with music, and it＊sdiscussed in the notes,

323
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,203
 because they model 每

324
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:05,161
 because simple sines and cosine modelmusical phenomena as a repeating pattern 每

325
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:08,486
 musical notes. The higher harmonics, thehigher terms,

326
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:11,351
 have higher frequencies, have shorter periods,

327
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:17,731
 but the sum has period onebecause the whole pattern can＊t repeat until the longest period repeats.

328
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:19,848
 All right. Until thelongest pattern is completed.

329
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:24,944
 Now,

330
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,248
 I＊m actually gonna post on the website 每

331
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:31,673
 I＊m going togive you a little MATLAB program that allows you to experiment with just these sorts ofsums.

332
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:35,053
 All right. That is, you choose n 每 it forms sums exactly like this 每

333
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,836
 you can choosethe a＊s, the amplitudes, you can choose the phases,

334
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,415
 and it will plot what a sum looks like.All right.

335
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:41,219
 It＊s called 每

336
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:45,272
 so I have MATLAB program with a graphical user interface.

337
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,378
 Iwrote this myself, actually, a couple years ago.

338
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:52,309
 I was very 每 it was the first I ever did inMATLAB,

339
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,141
 it was pretty clunky, let me tell ya. But last year,

340
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:57,916
 a student in the class, in 261,took it upon herself to modify it,

341
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,846
 which caused me to bump up her grade in the end,

342
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,785
 andit＊s really quite a nice little program.

343
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:03,614
 It＊s not complicated,

344
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:08,810
 but it＊ll show you howcomplicated these sums can be.

345
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,740
 All right. So there＊s a MATLAB program, which I＊ll poston the website,

346
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,144
 sine sum 每

347
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,688
 actually it＊s called sine sum two because sine sum one was myown version,

348
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:22,620
 which is now on the ash heap of history.

349
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:30,697
 All right. To plot these sums 每 andit＊s really quite 每

350
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:33,374
 I mean it＊s 每 talk about fun, you know 每

351
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:38,353
 I mean to see how complicateda pattern you can build up out of relatively simple building blocks like this,

352
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,315
 it＊s reallypretty good. So we may even 每

353
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:44,751
 we＊re actually trying to see if we can do a homeworkassignment based on this 每

354
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,338
 based on the program.

355
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:50,627
 There＊s a feature in the program thatallows you too actually to play the sound that＊s associated with this.

356
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:51,265
 That is,

357
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,160
 if youconsider these things as modeling 每

358
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,108
 if you consider the simple sinusoids as modeling apure musical note,

359
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,490
 then a combination models a combination of musical notes,

360
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,109
 and if youput a little button, it plays sound,

361
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,408
 you＊ll get something that may sound good or may notsound good.

362
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,378
 But it＊s interesting to try. Unfortunately,

363
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,874
 the play sound feature doesn＊t seemto work on the Mac,

364
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:08,864
 it only seems to work on Windows.

365
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,291
 It requires Windows MediaPlayer or something like that;

366
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,031
 Bill Gates＊ version of death 4.2 or something,

367
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:16,831
 I don＊tknow. Anyway,

368
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,973
 so we have to see if we can fix it to work on the Mac,

369
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,453
 but 每

370
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,625
 everythingworks on the Mac fine except for playing the note.

371
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,266
 So I＊ll put that up on the web in a zipfile,

372
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:31,022
 and you should fool around with it a little bit.

373
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:31,413
 Okay?

374
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:37,838
 Because it＊ll give you a goodsense of just how complicated these things can be.

375
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:41,970
 All right. Now, so how complicatedcan they be?

376
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,573
 That＊s the question that I really wanna address.

377
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:47,980
 I mean,

378
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,744
 this sum is alreadymore complicated than just the sine and the cosine alone,

379
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:57,423
 but it doesn＊t begin to exhaustthe possibilities that we want to be able to deal with.

380
00:24:57,423 --> 00:25:00,831
 Let me say, to advance thediscussion, actually,

381
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:05,669
 and to really get to the point where I can ask the question in areasonable way,

382
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:10,682
 how general a periodic phenomena can we expect to model with sumslike this.

383
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:14,326
 Let me say a little bit about the different forms that you can write the sum inbecause algebraically 每

384
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:17,215
 for algebraic reasons, primarily algebraic reasons,

385
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,173
 there are moreor less convenient ways to write this sum.

386
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:20,968
 Okay.

387
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:24,018
 And I think it＊s worth commentingabout it,

388
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:35,386
 just a little bit. So different ways of writing the sum 每

389
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:40,549
this sort of sum 每 k equalsone to n of a sub 每

390
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,111
 I＊m gonna use a capital in here 每 [inaudible] 每

391
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:49,282
 a sub k sine of two pi kt plus fe sub k.

392
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:57,123
 All right. Now, you can lose the phase, so to speak,

393
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,955
 and bring in 每 write itin terms of sines and cosines,

394
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:03,695
 if you use the addition formula for the sine function.

395
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,064
 That isthe 每

396
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:09,889
 the formula for the sine of the sum of two angles.

397
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:26,504
 So if you write sine of two pi k tplus fe k as the sine of two pi k t times the cosine of fe k plus the cosine of two pi k ttimes the sine of fe k,

398
00:26:26,504 --> 00:26:28,255
 just using the addition formula,

399
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:35,979
 than that sum can be written interms of sines and cosines.

400
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:39,566
 You can write the sum in the form 每 let me use 每

401
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:43,878
 for differentcoefficients, say sum from k equals one to n,

402
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,929
 little a k times the cosine of two pi k t,

403
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:50,835
 pluslittle b sub k times the sine of two pi k t.

404
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:52,963
 All right. And you know where the 每

405
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:57,965
 how thelittle ak＊s and the bk＊s are related to the capital A＊s in the phase just by working it out.

406
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,603
All right. So capital A sub k times this thing,

407
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:02,296
 and then there＊s a term coming from thephase 每

408
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:03,592
 you haven＊t lost information about the phase in some sense,

409
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:04,426
 it＊s still there,

410
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:09,049
 butit＊s represented differently in terms of the coefficients out in the form of the sum.

411
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:09,595
 Allright.

412
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:09,490
 This is a very common way of writing these sorts of trigonometric sums.

413
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,638
 As amatter of fact, I＊d say it＊s more common in 每

414
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:17,065
 if you look in the applications, even if youlook in the textbooks,

415
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:20,759
 it＊s more common to write the sum this form than it is to write it inthis form.

416
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:24,305
 But there equivalent, all right?

417
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:24,652
 You can go back and for the between the two.

418
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:28,451
And you can also allow for a constant term,

419
00:27:28,451 --> 00:27:30,814
 you can shift the whole thing up.

420
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:33,224
 And that＊salso usually done for purposes of generality.

421
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:52,695
 All right. You can add a constant term.

422
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:55,044
 Andit＊s usually written in the form a zero over two,

423
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:57,153
 the reason why a zero over two is in thereis because of yet,

424
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,722
 another form of writing it. Let me just write out the rest of it:

425
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:02,863
 a zeroover two plus, again, sum from n equals 每

426
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:13,771
 for k equals one to n to n of a sub k, cosine oftwo pi k t plus b sub k,

427
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:17,726
 sine of two pi k t. All right.

428
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:22,701
 And electrical engineers always callthis the dc component.

429
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,385
 I hate that. All right. But they always do.

430
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:25,869
 All right.

431
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:29,064
 Who alllearned to call this the dc component?

432
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:31,638
 Yeah, I hate that. Not everybody, I＊m glad to seethat.

433
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:34,687
 That＊s because you think of a periodic phenomena,

434
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:36,441
 you think about alternative 每 Idon＊t know what you think about.

435
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:39,896
 You think about alternating current or voltagesomehow is a periodic part,

436
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:41,696
 but then there＊s a direct part that doesn＊t alternate.

437
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:43,948
 There＊s adc part 每 direct current part 每

438
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,403
 that doesn＊t alternate, and that＊s that term.

439
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:51,302
 The reason whyI don＊t like calling this the dc component is because what if a problem had absolutelynothing to do with current,

440
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:52,631
 you know?

441
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,771
 You＊re sometimes trapped by your language,

442
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:58,751
 andthe field again, as I will say over and over again,

443
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:04,105
 is so broad and so diverse that you don＊twant to trap yourself into thinking about it in only one way.

444
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:05,610
 You know.

445
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,830
 You may bemodeling some very complicated phenomena,

446
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,456
 and you say, ＆What is a dc component?＊ Issomebody gonna look at you,

447
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:16,315
 like, ＆What are you talking about?＊ You know?

448
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:17,262
 All right.Now,

449
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:21,390
 so that＊s a very common way of writing the form of the sum,

450
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,155
 but by far, the mostconvenient way algebraically,

451
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:30,333
 and really in many ways, conceptually,

452
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,089
 is to use complexexponentials to write the sum,

453
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:36,251
 not the real sines and cosines. By far.

454
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:40,838
 And this is prettymuch the last time I＊m gonna use sines and cosines.

455
00:29:40,838 --> 00:29:43,516
 Or pretty much the last time I＊mgonna write the expression like this,

456
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:49,844
 so it＊s by far better. And I＊ll have to convince you ofthis.

457
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:53,302
 All right. Primarily, algebraically, but also conceptually,

458
00:29:53,302 --> 00:30:05,999
 is by far better to use torepresent sine and cosine via complex exponentials.

459
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:12,930
 And write the sum that way. Allright. so what do I mean by that?

460
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:18,098
 Let me just remind you, of course, in either the two pi in t,

461
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:22,490
 [inaudible] formula is cosine of two pi n t plus or k 每

462
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,437
 or I guess I＊m calling it k,

463
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:25,811
 letme stick with the terminology there 每

464
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:31,253
 two pi k t plus sine of two pi k plus i times the sineof two pi k t.

465
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:32,942
 Oh, yes, that＊s something else. All right.

466
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:42,087
 I＊m gonna announce a declarationof principle.

467
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:45,177
 I is the square root of minus one, in this class.

468
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:52,194
 Not j. Deal with it. Get over it.All right.

469
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:59,491
 For me, for this class, it＊s i. You can use j if you want.

470
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:14,779
 I will use i. Now,because of Oiler＊s formula 每

471
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,942
 Oiler＊s famous formula 每

472
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:22,142
 you can express sines and cosinesin terms of the completive exponential ant it＊s conjugate,

473
00:31:22,142 --> 00:31:23,519
 that is, very simple formula,

474
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,058
 thecosine is the real part and the sine is the imaginary part.

475
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:32,679
 So cosine of two pi k t is then eto the pi i is the real part.

476
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,572
 Two pi i k t plus e to the minus two pi i k t over two.

477
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:43,837
 And thesine of two pi k t, likewise,

478
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:52,951
 is the imaginary part that＊s e to the two pi i k t minus e to theminus two pi i k t divided by two i.

479
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:56,705
 There is an appendix in the notes on the algebra ofcomplex numbers,

480
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:59,025
 so if you＊re at all rusty on that, you should review that.

481
00:31:59,025 --> 00:31:59,895
 All right.

482
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:03,193
Because you＊re gonna want to be able to manipulate complex numbers,

483
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:03,265
 and I＊m thinkingprimarily here in terms of working with complex conjugates with real parts andimaginary parts.

484
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:11,050
 You＊re gonna wanna be able to do that with confidence and gusto.

485
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,889
 Allright.

486
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,812
 So if you＊re at all rusty in manipulating complex number 每

487
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:17,093
 and complexexponentials, look over the chapter.

488
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:18,915
 All right? Matter of fact, on the first problem set,

489
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:24,242
there are several problems that you give you practice in exactly this and manipulatingcomplex numbers.

490
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,760
 All right. Complex exponentials. Now, because of this 每

491
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,062
 and I won＊t 每I won＊t write it out in detail,

492
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:34,111
 you can obviously then convert a sum which is not gone,

493
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:35,705
which looks in terms of sines and cosines 每

494
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:39,045
 in terms of complex exponentials.

495
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:53,489
 So you canconvert a trigonometric sum as before to the form sum 每

496
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:59,138
 and I＊ll write it like this 每 sumfrom k equals minus n to n,

497
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,381
 so it includes the zeros term, the constant term,

498
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:05,467
 c sub k 每 e tothe two pi i k t. All right.

499
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:09,307
 We are now 每 the C sub k＊s are complex numbers.

500
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:29,877
 Everythingin sight is complex. So, All right.

501
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:37,974
 The c k＊s are complex. Now, they can be 每

502
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:43,073
 all right 每they can be expressed 每 I won＊t do this and 每

503
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:44,882
 I was gonna give you a homework problemon this,

504
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:49,485
 but I decided not to. You can do this just for fun.

505
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,720
 You can see how the differentcoefficients are related.

506
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,114
 So start with the expression in terms of sines and cosines,

507
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,475
 makethe substitution in terms of the complex exponential and see what happens to thecoefficients.

508
00:33:56,475 --> 00:34:00,068
 All right. You will find, actually, a very important symmetry property.

509
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:01,604
 Allright. These are complex numbers,

510
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:03,378
 but they＊re not just arbitrary complex numbers,

511
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:07,854
 theysatisfy symmetry property.

512
00:34:07,854 --> 00:34:12,234
 And it＊s because of the symmetry that the total sum is real.

513
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:15,877
All right. The symmetry property 每 this comes up a lot 每

514
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:18,207
 and we＊ll see similar sort ofthings reflected actually,

515
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:19,899
 when we talked about Fourier transforms.

516
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:25,518
 That is c sub 每 thesum goes from minus n up to n 每

517
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:26,816
 they satisfy the property,

518
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:27,696
 the c sub minus k is c sub kcomplex conjugate,

519
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:30,601
 c k bar. All right.

520
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:36,028
 That＊s a very important identity that＊s satisfied bythe coefficients for a real signal like that,

521
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:38,265
 and it comes up often. All right.

522
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:43,187
 it＊s one of thethings you have to keep in mind.

523
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:43,807
 All right.

524
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:47,093
 That＊s a consequence of actually making theconversion.

525
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:47,987
 That is,

526
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,417
 starting with a formula in terms of sines and cosines,

527
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:52,903
 and then gettingthe formula in terms of the complex numbers.

528
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:57,963
 All right. Conversely, conversely, if youstart with the sum of this form,

529
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,313
 all right,

530
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:01,723
 where the coefficient satisfies the symmetryproperty,

531
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:03,923
 then the total some will be real.

532
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:07,211
 That＊s because you can group a positive termand a negative term,

533
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:10,419
 and because of this relationship here,

534
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:13,325
 you＊ll be adding a complexnumber plus its conjugate,

535
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,009
 so you＊ll get a real 每 results out of that.

536
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:16,763
 All right. So if thecoefficients satisfy this,

537
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:19,220
 then the signal is real. And conversely,

538
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,295
 if the signal is real andyou write it like that,

539
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:25,467
 then the coefficients have to satisfy the symmetry property.

540
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:28,070
 Yeah?Student:What is that 每 [inaudible] 每

541
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,977
Instructor (Brad Osgood):What is that line?

542
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:32,473
 That line is 每 indicates complex conjugate.

543
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:36,067
All right. So for a general 每 all right, do I have to say anymore first?

544
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,699
 So for generalcomplex number a plus b i,

545
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:39,941
 the conjugate is a minus b i. Okay.

546
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:42,157
 There are differentnotations for complex conjugates,

547
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:43,987
 sometimes some people use different 每 some peopleuse an asterisk,

548
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:49,236
 a star, some people even use a dagger. All right.

549
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,102
 But I think by far 每 it＊strue, I＊m not making that up.

550
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:54,489
 But this is the most common notation. All right.

551
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:58,354
 And that isanother notation I will use.Okay.

552
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:08,822
 Now, now, now, now. We are ready, at last,

553
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:15,537
 to at least ask the question that＊s reallyat the heart of all of this.

554
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:23,197
 How general can this be? How general can this be?

555
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:24,840
 I mean, I＊min the form now, algebraically 每

556
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,800
 well,

557
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,812
 I＊m in the form now where I can ask the question,

558
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,725
and as we＊ll see algebraically,

559
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:45,946
 writing sums of this form is by far the easiest way toapproach it.

560
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:52,316
So we can now ask the fundamental question.

561
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:56,287
 Why is there something rather thannothing?

562
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:59,065
 Let＊s kick that one around for awhile. The fundamental question 每

563
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,003
 so again,

564
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:08,204
 f oft is a periodic function of period one.

565
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:20,408
 All right. Can we write it, f of t and that sort ofsum,

566
00:37:20,408 --> 00:37:26,521
 k going from minus n to n of c sub k e to the two pi i k t.

567
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:27,616
 So again,

568
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:30,595
 I＊m assuming thesignal is real here so the coefficient satisfies symmetry relation;

569
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:33,316
 just keep your eye on theball here.The fundamental question is this.

570
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:36,721
 You have a general periodic function, can you write itas a trigonometric sum?

571
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,768
 Can you express it in terms of sines and cosines?

572
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:41,108
 Can youexpress it in terms of the fundamental building blocks?

573
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:44,116
 All right. By the way, linearity isplaying a role here,

574
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:46,714
 although again, I haven＊t said it explicitly until now,

575
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:50,290
 we＊reconsidering linear combinations of the basic building blocks.

576
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,543
 We＊re considering a linearway of combining the basic trigonometric functions,

577
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:58,910
 the basic periodic functions. Allright. A linear way of doing that.

578
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:08,850
So that＊s the fundamental question. And the answer 每

579
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,544
 I＊ll tell you next time.

580
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:18,784
 But youdon＊t think I＊d make such a big deal out of it if the answer was no.

581
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:25,919
 So 每 but there＊s a lotto do. And answering this question 每

582
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:28,879
 answering this question led to a lot of very profoundand far-

583
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:38,682
reaching investigations.All right. Now 每 but I want to get started on it.

584
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:41,626
 All right. Now, let me give you a littleclue.

585
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:42,957
 Yeah 每Student:

586
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:47,042
[Inaudible] earlier you were starting with one.

587
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,158
Instructor (Brad Osgood):Pardon? Why am I not starting with one?

588
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:49,647
 Well, for one thing每

589
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:53,474
 so the question is why does the sum go from minus n to n,

590
00:38:53,474 --> 00:38:53,961
 and why doesn＊t it just gofrom one to n?

591
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:56,063
Well, for one thing, if it went from one to n,

592
00:38:56,063 --> 00:38:56,880
 the signal wouldn＊t be real, right?

593
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,213
Remember there＊s this combination of the positive terms and the negative terms,

594
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:00,703
 allright?

595
00:39:00,703 --> 00:39:02,622
 And the positive terms and the negative terms 每

596
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:04,108
 because of the symmetry relationof the coefficient,

597
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:07,019
 the positive and the negative terms combine to give you a real signal 每

598
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,216
to give you a real part.

599
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:11,659
 And it＊s a fact that if you start with a real signal in terms of sinesand cosines,

600
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,484
 and then you use complex exponentials to express it this way,

601
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:16,183
 you will findthat it＊s the symmetric sum.

602
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:18,615
 It goes from minus n to n. Okay.By the way,

603
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,495
 I should have said something over here, I suppose.

604
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:25,936
 Note one thing, by theway, that c sub-zero is equal to c sub-

605
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:32,540
minus zero. Zero being what it is. C sub minus zerois equal to c sub-

606
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,037
zero is equal to c zero bar.

607
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:42,489
 What does it mean to say that a complexnumber is equal to its conjugate?

608
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,652
Student:It is real.Instructor (Brad Osgood):

609
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:45,714
It＊s real. All right.

610
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,623
 So the one coefficient that you know forsure is real,

611
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:48,349
 others may be real, it may just work out that way,

612
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:51,712
 but the one coefficient thatyou know is real for sure,

613
00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:55,073
 is the zero of coefficient. All right. so it must be real.

614
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,327
 So c zerois real. That＊s just a little aside,

615
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:01,425
 c zero is real.All right. You have to be a little 每

616
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:03,792
 you have to cut me a little slack here. Like I said,

617
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,152
 weall have to cut each other a little slack.

618
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:08,930
 There＊s so many little bits, you know, to observe 每

619
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,656
little pieces, little comments and things like that.

620
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:14,105
 I can＊t make all of them, all right? Ihope I put all of them,

621
00:40:14,105 --> 00:40:16,155
 or most of them, in the lecture notes, all right,

622
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,129
 in the notes so yousee these things. But,

623
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,591
 as I say,

624
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,628
 there＊s so many things along the way that you could pointout,

625
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,662
 that you can note,

626
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,385
 that we just can＊t do it all because I want to keep my eye on thebigger picture.

627
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:28,378
 All right.

628
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:30,044
 But this is one thing that comes up often enough.

629
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:30,890
 So there＊ll be,you know,

630
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,058
 there＊ll be instances where you have to read the 每

631
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,911
 read the notes carefully andtry to make note of all those things.

632
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:37,427
 And it＊s hard. It＊s hard. You know,

633
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:42,524
 it＊s hard to knowwhen you＊re gonna need this little fact or that little fact because there＊s so many littlefacts.

634
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,737
But you＊ll see when the whole thing 每 when you 每

635
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:45,190
 if you keep the big picture in mind,

636
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,574
 inmany cases the details will take care of themselves.

637
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:50,716
 Really. Now, where was I?Yes? A secret of the universe.

638
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:54,799
 All right.

639
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,203
 Here＊s a pretty big secret of the universe,

640
00:40:57,203 --> 00:40:59,499
actually, coming your way. When you try to apply 每

641
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,676
 when you＊re trying to see howmathematics works,

642
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:05,125
 and when you try to apply mathematics to various problems,

643
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,613
 youoften have a question like this. What if 每

644
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:10,607
 how can 每 what 每 how can something happen?

645
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:11,169
All right.

646
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,642
 Is it possible to write something like this?

647
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:16,530
 All right. Now, a very good firstapproach 每

648
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,564
 and I＊m serious about this.

649
00:41:17,564 --> 00:41:21,312
 When you＊re doing your own work and you＊retrying to look at a mathematical model of something,

650
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,427
 you say, can I do something likethis?

651
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:26,122
 Often the first step is to suppose that you can,

652
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:28,996
 and see what the consequences are.All right.

653
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:31,964
 Then later on, you can say, all right,

654
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:35,970
 then maybe I should try this because thatseems to be what has to happen.

655
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:39,056
 All right. And then you go backwards. All right.

656
00:41:39,056 --> 00:41:41,900
 Andmathematicians will never tell you this because they like to sort of cover their tracks.

657
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,831
They say, ＆Well, it obviously goes like this,

658
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:45,245
＊ you know, and,

659
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:48,100
 ＆We＊re obviously going todefine this formula and that formula,

660
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,040
 and life is going to work out so simply.

661
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,495
＊ But whatthey don＊t show you is often that first step of saying,

662
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:55,607
 suppose the problem is solved, whathas to happen?

663
00:41:55,607 --> 00:42:02,025
 All right. So suppose you can do this.

664
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:09,118
 We can write f of t equals the sumfrom k equals minus n to n,

665
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:14,517
 c sub-k e to the two pi i k t. What has to happen?

666
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:22,683
 All right.Now, by that I mean, if you can write this,

667
00:42:22,683 --> 00:42:27,687
 what are the coefficients? If you can write anequation like this,

668
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:29,957
 then what I＊m asking here is,

669
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:39,901
 what are the mystery coefficients interms of f?

670
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:46,216
 Coefficient c sub-k in terms of f 每 f is given to you.

671
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:47,612
 All right.

672
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:50,209
 So theunknowns in this expression are the coefficients.

673
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:52,755
 And the question is, can you solve forthem?

674
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:54,154
 All right. Suppose you can write it like that.

675
00:42:54,154 --> 00:43:00,275
 Can you solve for the coefficients?Can we solve for the c k?

676
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:04,583
 All right. I＊m gonna take a very na.ve approach.

677
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,272
 All right. I＊mgonna isolate it. What do you?

678
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:09,968
 It＊s like an algebraic equation. To start with an algebraicequation,

679
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:12,079
 isolate the unknown. So isolate, like, the,

680
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,303
 I don＊t know, Mth coefficient orsomething like that.

681
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,369
 All right. So isolate c m out of this. That is 每

682
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:36,362
 it＊s a big old sum,right? So f of t is, you know,

683
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:41,826
 all these terms plus c sub m e to the two pi i m t plus all therest of the terms.

684
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:46,981
 That is to say, I can write c sub-m e to the two pi i m t,

685
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:51,765
 is f of t minus allthe terms that don＊t involve m,

686
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:57,146
 so let me write it like this. Say, sum over k different fromm of c sub-

687
00:43:57,146 --> 00:44:00,200
k e to the two pi i k t. All right.

688
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,996
 I haven＊t done anything except algebraicallymanipulated the equation to bring the one mystery term,

689
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:08,660
 or one fixed term on the otherside. All right.

690
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,648
 All I did here 每 so f of t is this big sum.

691
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,983
 One of those terms in the sum is csub m e to the two pi i m t 每

692
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:15,710
 I wanna solve for the unknowns. All right.

693
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,597
 So solve for theunknowns one unknown at a time.

694
00:44:18,597 --> 00:44:20,996
 So this is the Mth term in the sum,

695
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:22,357
 bring that over tothe other side of the equation,

696
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:28,240
 write c sub m e to the two pi i m t is f of t minus all theterms that don＊t involve m.

697
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,043
 Okay. And then, write that as 每 that＊s almost isolating c sub-

698
00:44:35,043 --> 00:44:35,866
m,

699
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:38,561
 and not quite because it＊s got a complex exponential in front of it.

700
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:41,574
 So multiply bothsides 每 this board is not so great 每

701
00:44:41,574 --> 00:44:49,399
 multiply both sides by e to the minus two pi i m t.

702
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:49,948
 So csub-

703
00:44:49,948 --> 00:45:04,454
m is e to the minus two pi i m t times f of t minus the sum over all k different from mof c sub-

704
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:10,935
k e to the minus two pi i m t times e to the two pi i k t.

705
00:45:10,935 --> 00:45:17,470
 You with me? Nothing onmy sleeve. All right.

706
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:19,450
 All right. Now, that＊s brilliant.

707
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,061
 I have isolated one unknown in termsof all the other unknowns.

708
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:24,153
 All right. So,

709
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:27,270
 I don＊t know if one can say that we have reallymade progress here.

710
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,609
 So we need another idea. This is as far as algebra can take you.

711
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:31,767
 Allright. Algebra says, you wanna solve for the unknown,

712
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:34,017
 fine. Isolate, you know,

713
00:45:34,017 --> 00:45:35,552
 what didyour eighth grade teacher tell you?

714
00:45:35,552 --> 00:45:37,080
 Put the one unknown on one side of the equation,

715
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,710
 puteverything else on the other side of the equation.

716
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,764
 Hope and pray. All right.

717
00:45:41,764 --> 00:45:45,621
 So we put theone unknown on one side of the equation,

718
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,319
 everything else is on the other side of theequation.

719
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:48,718
 Hope and pray. Now,

720
00:45:48,718 --> 00:45:54,045
 the desperate mathematician at this point looking forsomething to do.

721
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:57,047
 Let me actually take this out one more algebraic step.

722
00:45:57,047 --> 00:46:00,382
 Let me justcombine those two exponentials there,

723
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,701
 and write this as c sub-

724
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:12,739
m is e to the minus two pi im t minus the sum over all terms different from m of c sub-

725
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:20,195
k e to the two pi i 每 two pi i kminus m times t.

726
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,432
 I＊m just combining the two complex exponentials there.

727
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:26,049
 All right. Great.Student:[Inaudible]Instructor (Brad Osgood):

728
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:30,887
What?Student:F of t.Instructor (Brad Osgood):

729
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,280
F of t. Picky, picky. All right. F of t minus.

730
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,235
 All right. Now,good. So now, they say that we need another idea.

731
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:41,884
 And the desperate mathematician atthis moment will think of one or two things 每

732
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:42,803
 one of two things.

733
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:44,157
 [Inaudible] theydifferentiate or integrate.

734
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:46,542
 I mean, what＊s beyond algebra? Calculus.

735
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,179
 What＊s in calculus?Derivatives and intervals.

736
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,017
 All right. So, here＊s a clue. Derivatives won＊t work,

737
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:54,654
 butintervals will.All right. We need another idea.

738
00:46:54,654 --> 00:46:57,266
 And that＊s a good idea, it＊s an inspired idea.

739
00:46:57,266 --> 00:47:00,338
 But[inaudible] because it works, and I＊ll show you way.

740
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:10,631
 So I＊m gonna integrate both sidesfrom zero to one over one period.

741
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:11,086
 All right.

742
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:12,764
 All I have to worry about here is one period.

743
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:15,514
Everything＊s periodic at period one, so I integrate over 每

744
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:25,410
 I integrate from zero to one.What if I do 每

745
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,695
 what do I get?Well, certainly, if I integrate zero to one of c sub-

746
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:33,168
m d t, that just gives me c sub-m. Allright.

747
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:39,325
 So what about the rest of it? So I get 每

748
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:46,119
 I get c sub-

749
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:50,705
m is equal to the interval fromzero to one,

750
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:55,488
 e to the minus two pi i m t, f of t d t,

751
00:47:55,488 --> 00:48:00,011
 minus the interval of the sum is the sumof the interval 每

752
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,266
 let me write this, sum from all the different 每

753
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:08,590
 all the terms k different m每 and the constant comes out 每

754
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,404
 c sub-k, the interval from zero to one, e to the two pi i kminus m 每

755
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:21,300
 k minus m 每 t d t. That＊s a t there. T. Ouch.

756
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,164
All right.

757
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:25,440
 I＊ve integrated both sides from zero to one.

758
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:38,009
 All right. Now, watch this. Allright. Watch.

759
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:42,198
 I can integrate that complex exponential,

760
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:43,233
 that＊s a simple function.

761
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:46,021
 I canintegrate that just like I integrated in calculus.

762
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:48,623
 All right. The interval from zero to one,

763
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:55,047
 eto the two pi i k minus m t d t. Now, k is different from m.

764
00:48:55,047 --> 00:49:00,008
 All right. If k is equal to m,I＊m just e to the zero here,

765
00:49:00,008 --> 00:49:02,293
 I just get one [inaudible] so the k is different from m.

766
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:05,923
 So theinterval of this is one over two pi i 每

767
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:06,617
 trust me 每

768
00:49:06,617 --> 00:49:09,551
 integrating this is the same as integratingan ordinary function 每

769
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,086
 two pi i, as you did in calculus.

770
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:17,937
One over two pi i k minus m e to the two pi i k minus m t,

771
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:23,584
 evaluated from t going fromzero to one. Straightforward integration.

772
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:30,220
 Straightforward integration, which is equal to 每

773
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:42,670
we are almost done. We are almost there.One over two pi i k minus m,

774
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,352
 that makes sense, right? Because k is different from m,

775
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:50,634
 soit＊s not a problem. E to the two pi i k minus m times one 每

776
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:53,707
 so that＊s e to the pi i k minusm minus e to the zero.

777
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:56,620
 All right. But either the two pi i k minus m,

778
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,861
 that＊s e to the two pi itimes an integer.

779
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:00,794
 That＊s like sine of two pi times an integer,

780
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:03,270
 cosine of two pi times aninteger 每 that＊s one.

781
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:08,119
 And e to the zero is also better known as one.

782
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,363
 So this is better knownas one minus one,

783
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:23,100
 which is better known as zero.Nothing. All this crap integrates zero.

784
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:33,273
 Excuse me. All right. Incredible. What is theupshot?

785
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:36,957
 It all goes away. What is the upshot? The upshot is,

786
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:41,614
 that c sub-m 每 what＊s left?What＊s left is c sub-

787
00:50:41,614 --> 00:50:43,719
m is the interval from zero to one 每 that 每

788
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:47,032
 all that 每 all the terms ofthe sum here are gone 每

789
00:50:47,032 --> 00:50:49,404
 are gone. They integrated out to zero.

790
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:58,144
 What remains is theinterval from zero to one of e to the minus two pi i m t f of t d t.

791
00:50:58,144 --> 00:51:00,929
All right. Now, in principle,

792
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:05,070
 this is known because you start out by assuming you knew f.

793
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,197
Suppose I know f, what has to happen? All right.

794
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:10,925
 Well, suppose I＊m given f, and I write fas this sum,

795
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:14,940
 what has to happen? Here is the answer. All right.

796
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:26,202
 Here is the answer. Let mesummarize.We have solved for the unknowns.

797
00:51:26,202 --> 00:51:31,597
 All right. So given f of t 每 periodic of period one 每

798
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:39,190
suppose we can write f of t as the sum,

799
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:46,203
 k equals minus n to n of c k e to the two pi i k t.

800
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,646
What has to happen?

801
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:58,198
 What has to happen is the coefficients have to be given by thisformula.

802
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,757
 Then you must have 每 I＊ll just write c sub-

803
00:51:59,757 --> 00:52:01,178
k instead of c sub-m 每

804
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:07,931
 [inaudible] ofthe k of coefficient is the interval from zero to one of e to the minus two pi i k t f of t d t.

805
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:10,396
That＊s what has to happen. All right.

806
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:15,598
It＊s an important first step in applying mathematics to any given problem,

807
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:19,203
 whether it＊s amathematical problem or a non-

808
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,984
mathematical problem. Suppose the problem is solved,

809
00:52:21,984 --> 00:52:24,139
what has to happen? If the problem is solved,

810
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:24,614
 mean,

811
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:28,559
 suppose you have this representationthen the coefficients have to be given by this formula.

812
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,078
All right. So next time, I＊m gonna turn this around saying,

813
00:52:30,078 --> 00:52:31,714
 suppose we give thesecoefficients by the formula,

814
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:37,188
 do we have something like that, and in what sense?

815
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:41,176
 And thatwill lead us to great things.All right.

816
00:52:41,176 --> 00:52:41,176
 So more on that next time.[End of Audio]Duration:
