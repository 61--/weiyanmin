Instructor (Brad Osgood):
do that shortly.
 There were a couple of people who joined the class late,
couple of extra days.
 Put that Daily away.
team. Anyway,
 so I＊ll put it up either today 每 sometime over the next couple days,
right?
 And the latest problem set,
 Problem Set 3, is now posted on the website.
 All right.
Any questions about anything; anything on anybody＊s mind?
Transform so far,
 class?
Student:Whoo.Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Yeah, all right.
 That＊s the spirit. All right.
you 每 as a matter of fact,
 let me reintroduce the star of the show.
Fourier Transform and its inverse,
plunging back into specific properties,
 specific transforms and some properties,
inverse.
So, again, f of t is a signal and the Fourier Transform or function,
 same thing,Transform,
 I use this notation.
 I want to comment about that,
 again, in just a second.
Integral from my infinity 每 infinity of either the -
2p I ST, F of T,
Fourier Transform looks very similar except for a change in sign in the exponential.
the inverse Fourier Transform of 每 I use a different function,
 although it doesn＊t matter.
We＊re gonna go from -
8 to 8 of either the +2p I ST,
 G of S, DS, okay?All right.
 Now,
 I want to make a few general comments here.
write down,
 but it＊s actually quite a complicated operation,
 all right?
such a simple operation.
make the thing oscillate,
 and computing an infinite integral from -
sorts of peril,
 all right?Now,
 the rigor police are off duty,
 for the most part, all right?
concerned about the existence of those integrals.
 That is an issue, all right,
something we＊re gonna have to deal with but not right away.
 Right now,a little practical,
 hands-the formulas.
So I＊m not gonna worry about the convergence right now.
about later, although,
 it＊s never gonna be a big issue for us,
 or rather, we＊re gonna 每 well,
we＊re gonna talk about it in a number of different ways,
 all right,
worry about.
So when I write down the definition of the Fourier Transform,
said was the Fourier Transform is defined by that integral whenever the integral exists,
right?
 So the question is the existence of the integral on the existence of the integral,
is to say convergence of the integral 每 of the integral.
 All right, so more on this,
extent, later.
The set of points but just to introduce a bit of terminology here,
you＊ve said,
 and I actually have used,
 I think, somewhat informally.
which the integral does exist,
 that is to say,
 for which the Fourier Transform exists,
called the spectrum,
 all right?
defined,
 that is to say for which the integral exists,
 is called the spectrum.
So when I made the bold statement last time that every signal has a spectrum,
signal is determined by a spectrum,
 I was thinking of exactly this 每 that is that,
cases,
 the integral is not an issue; that is it will exist,
 all right?
doesn＊t exist, of course,analysis.
All right. Now,
 that＊s one comment that I wanted to make.
 As I said,off duty.
 I＊ll tell you when we have to worry about those kinds of questions.
 Now,using for the Fourier Transform is not universal.
 As a matter of fact,
definition or universal standard,
 universal notation for the Fourier Transform.
So definitions and notations vary,
 all right?
 You should be aware of this,
每 and no single notation is perfect,
 all right?
context. So you see 每 you will see,
 for example,
 the notation F Hat 每 and really,
 sort of,corresponding to what we did for Fourier Coefficiency,
Hat of S, or what I＊m calling,
 for the Fourier Transform.
You will also see 每 this is a pretty cute notation.
inverse Fourier Transform.
 I＊ll call it T, all right?
 You＊ll see that notation.
uncommon at all, all right?
 You also see 每 that＊s probably the cutest one,
 but it,sort of,
gets lost in typesetting.
is to use a lowercase letter for the function 每 for the signal,
Fourier Transform.
So you also see f of t for the signal,
 and F of S for the Transform,
 all right?
with this notation is that it＊s not so good when you talk about duality,
talk about today,
 actually,
there ought to be made.
Anyway,
 but it＊s useful 每 all these notations are useful in some context,
useful in every context.
 There＊s always some ambiguity; there＊s always some clash,
right?
 And you have to be flexible,
particular author,
 the reference that you＊re looking at,
use different notations.
There＊s also a notation that people use for the,
 sort of,
 sibling relationship,
mean more to you in just a second when I talk about duality,
Fourier Transform.
 So some people write things like F of T corresponds to F of S.
 I,of, use that notation,
 but there＊s this other notation,
 which I think is just idiotic,
like a subset notation or something like that,
 right?
Like, does it go this way,
 or the other way,
 or something like that?
 I hate that notation,
but it＊s used.
 Braceval uses this,
 God rest his soul,
 but it＊s a stupid notation.
 I＊m sorry,you know?
 He＊s dead; it＊s gone.
 All right.
 Finally 每 and it may have something like that.
Anyway, say no notation is perfect,
 but some notations are worse than others.
Finally,
 it＊s not universally agreed on how the Fourier Transform itself should be defined,
all right?
 There are different definitions 每 I think,
 actually, let me just go back.
notation.
 It＊s sometimes awkward in certain context,
ambiguous,
 and somehow I tend to gravitate toward that more than others,
 but, again,
can choose what you want,
 and you＊ll see them all in use.
Anyway, I was gonna say there are also different definitions that are in use.
 For example,
where do you put the minus sign,
 all right?
 So you will see this definition.
Fourier Transform of F at S is the integral for -
8 to 8 of E to the I ST,
 F of T, DT,2p up there,
 or you sometimes what you see is I omega T instead of S,
 all right?
And you＊ll see the inverse Fourier Transform 每 excuse me,
 a minus, without the 2p.
You＊ll see this notation.
integral for -
8 to 8 of either the -
I ST, F of T, DT,2p out front.
inverse Fourier Transform with a minus sign,
 all right?
2p out in front.
 All combinations are in use,
 all right?
 E to the +I ST,
 F of T, DT,
inverse Fourier Transform is the integral for -
8 to 8 be to the -
I ST, F of S, DS,
 all right?
You＊ll see all these notations in use,
you or somehow otherwise you have to figure out which particular convention is in use,
all right?
This one is actually especially popular in physics,
 all right?
optics, for example,
 where the Fourier Transform comes in.
definition of the Fourier Transform,
 sometimes with a 2p in there.
you can stick it there.
 If you don＊t like it,
 you can stick it someplace else,
definition for the inverse Fourier Transform,
 all right?
All I can say is be careful out there.
In the notes,
 I moved this in various places; I＊m not sure the best place to put this.
it＊s now at the end of the chapter called 每 the chapter on convolution,
very shortly,
 there＊s a section called Chase the Constant or something like that,
stole from a book by Tom Kerner.
And that tells you how the different formulas change when you,
 you know,
the plus sign to a minus sign,
 when you change where you put the 2p and so on,
 all right?
And so it＊s,
 sort of,another case,them,
 and you will be likely to run across them.
 Okay.that.Now,
 I think I may print that out separately and actually just give it to you,
 sort of,
dictionary so you can make that translation because,
 as I say,
what can I say?
definition.
commonly 每 even then I＊m a little bit hesitant to say that,
the most commonly accepted convention,
 but by no means,
 is it universal.
Okay. All right.
 And we also had last time 每 a reminder we did last time,
basic examples of the Fourier Transform,
 calculating the Fourier Transform,
 and, again,
at this stage,
the definition.
 You have to carry out the integration if you can,
 all right?
of getting around it.
 We＊ll learn, then,
allow us to calculate new Fourier Transforms from old Fourier Transforms,
 but, for now,
right at the beginning,
 there＊s nothing to do except plug into the formula.
So the basic examples we had,
 which come up very often in applications,
rectangle function,
 p of T,
 and that＊s the function that looks like this.
 It＊s 1 from -. to .
and then 0 outside the interval,
it doesn＊t make any difference in the calculation,
sync function,
 Fp of S is sync of S,
 which is,
 in my convention,
 sign of pS over pS,
that＊s, by the way, of course,
 another thing that＊s not universally agreed upon.
people define the sync function without the p in here.
over S,
 or sign of X over X without the p.
 What are you gonna do?do?
The other example that we had,
 I didn＊t carry out the calculation completely,
 but, again,
was based on just calculating the integral.
 In this case,
parts.
 It＊s the triangle function has Slope 1 going up from -
1 to 1,to 1, 0,
 that＊s lambda of T,
 and the Fourier Transform there is the sync2,
 nice result,
of S, okay?
All right.
 I want to do one more particular case that＊s really cool,
 actually,
comes up quite a bit in applications,
 and then we are going to take the different path,
second path that I talked about,
Transform,
of functions or modifications of functions.
But let me do one more explicit example for you,
 and that is our friend the bell curve,
Gaussian.
 That＊s a very important function in many applications,
property with regard to the Fourier Transform.
 So, as the third example,
basic Gaussian F of T = E to -p T2.
Now, again,
 there＊s a question of normalization here,
 all right?
bell-shaped curve,
 which comes up in probability distributions,
there.
I mean,
 it has a height of one,
 and with this normalization,exponent,
 that normalizes the area under the curve to be one.
doing it,
 but it＊s the way of doing it that＊s,
 somehow,
when you＊re working with Fourier Transforms.
So the result when you make this normalization is the integral from -
8 to 8, either the -T2,
 DT is 1.
 Now, as tempted as I am,
 I＊m not gonna show you why that＊s true.
gonna do the calculation.
get that result going back to Oilier.
You cannot do this by direct integration because the function,
 E to the -elementary anti-derivative.
calculus.
 It has to be done by a very devious other means,
 and it＊s done in the notes.
should look it over.
 If you have any questions,
talking about it because it＊s such a famous and elegant trick,
 but, in the interest of time,
think I won＊t go through the derivation,
 all right, but that＊s an important result,
surprising result.
 I mean, why Ep 1,formula?
 But they do.
So here＊s what I want to show you,
 and to let the cat out of the bag,
it comes from is that the Gaussian is itself 每 no,
 the Gaussian is itself.
myself too, and you are yourselves,
 but that＊s not so interesting.
Fourier Transform of the Gaussian is itself.
 That is if F of T is equal to,
normalization,
 either the -p T2,
the same function,
 either the -p S2.
 I＊m using a different variable there,
is that the Fourier Transform of the Gaussian is the Gaussian.
Now, I mean,
complicated operation,
 as I＊m gonna go through this to show you how it works.
function should turn out to be itself under Fourier Transforms is really quite striking.
We＊ll also see,
 soon, that 每 you remember,
relationships between the time domain and the frequency domain,
various examples of that,
 and, somehow,
out in the time and the frequency domain; there＊s no difference.
 Because, often,
happens is if a function is spread out in one domain,
together in the other domain or vice versa,
 all right?
We＊ll see that,
 actually, as an example of 每 well,
Fourier Transform,
 and what this says,
of the Gaussian is itself,
 means, somehow,frequency, all right?
occur to you to think about unless you knew this result,
 all right?
So why is something like this true,
 all right? We have, again,
the definition.
 So let me write 每 in this case,
other unnatural acts on the Fourier Transform,
 so watch.
So let me call,
 again,
 if F of T is = to either the -p T2,
Transform. So that＊s the integral for -8 to 8,
 E to the -2p I ST,
 E to the -p T2, DT, okay?
And I am actually gonna evaluate this integral,
 all right?
 Not by any,
 sort of,
fundamental theorem of calculus or anything like that.
 That won＊t work,
clever trick that will actually allow us to carry out the integration after an initial,
slight of hand.
That is to say I＊m gonna differentiate with respect to S,
 all right?
 That is F prime of S,
and this can be justified 每 the rigor police are off duty,
 but even if they＊re on duty,
differentiating under the integral sign.
 So the integral for -
8 to 8,
thing is DDS.
 The only thing that depends on S here is this complex exponential,
the 2p I ST,
 and then either the -
p T2 stays the same; it doesn＊t get hit by the derivative.
So the derivative of this with respect to S is equal to the integral for -
8 to 8 -2p I T,
the -2p I ST,
 then E to the -
p T2, DT, okay?
All right.
 Now,
 watch this.
 You factor out the I,
integral for -8 to 8.
 I want to group terms in a very suggestive way.
the -2p I ST,
 and then 2p T - 2p T ℅ E to the -p T2, DT,
because it cries out to be integrated by parts,
 all right?
brings down this factor of 2p T or -
2p T here, all right?
integrated by parts.
 This is the U.
 This is the DV,
 okay?
And if I do that,
 what happens?
 Well, if DV,
 once again,
 is -2p T ℅ E to the -
p T2, VT,then V is E to the -
p T2, all right?
 Derivative of this E to the -
respect to T,
 brings down to the -
2p T,
 all right?
 And if U is equal to E to the -2p I ST,
then DU = -2p I S,
 E to the -2p I ST,
 2p I ST, DT, all right?
respect to T,
 or D-ing with respect to T,
 so to speak, okay?
All right.
 So, again,UV,
 evaluated between AB - the integral from A to B of VDU,
 all right?
that work out in this case?
 In this case,
 there＊s an I times the whole thing,
 right?
there＊s an I ℅ U ℅ V,
 which is E to the -
p T2, that＊s a V, -U?
 U is 每 yeah, -2p I ST,
 and evaluated between -
8 to 8,
 minus the integral from -of VDU.
 V is either the -p T2,
 DU is -2p I S,
 E to the -2p I ST, DT,
 all right?
braces because there＊s an I in front of the whole thing.
 Cool? Way cool.
All right. Now,
 what about these boundary terms here?
between -8 to 8.
 What happens to that?
 Gone, all right,
value one. E to the -
p T2 is going to 0 at both +8 and -
8, all right?off.
 It is gone.
What remains?
 What remains is -2p I S,
 a minus sign here,
 and then there＊s an I in front,
all right?
 So if I got all that right,
 it＊s gonna be an I ℅ an I,
 and I ℅ I is a -1, right?
is gonna be 每 right.
 There＊s a minus, a minus,
 and then an I ℅ an I gives you an extra -
1.
It＊s gonna be minus 每 the integral for -
8 to 8 of 2p I S 每 2p S ℅ E to -
2p I ST, E to the -T2, DT, okay?
Now,
 I＊m integrating with respect to T.
 This comes out.
 This depends on S.
 So this is -S integral for -8 to 8 of E to the -2p ST,
 E to the -p T2, DT. Brilliant.
where I started.
 All those years of education,
 all that work,
 what did it get me?
where I started,
 except there＊s an extra factor out front.
 That is this is equal to -
of S,
 the original Fourier Transform.
Gaussian.
 Integral for -8 to 8 ,
 E to the -2p I ST ℅ E to the -p T2,
 all right?
So what have I shown here?
 I have F prime of S = -2p S ℅ F of S.
 Oh,
simple differential equation for F,
 kids, right?
of 0, E to the -p S2.
 That＊s the only solution to that baby, okay?
And what is F of 0; what is capital F of 0?
 Capital F of 0,
Transform actually, right?
 When S = 0 this is -8 to 8,
 E to the -2p I, 0 ℅ T,
 E to the -p T2,DT.
 That＊s the integral for -
8 to 8, E to the -p T2, DT,
 which is 1, okay?
actual retail value of the answer?
 That says that F of S,
 capital F of S is E to the -p S2.
This says that capital F of S is E to the -
p S2.
 Done. Fantastic, fantastic, all right?
So again,
 I take the Fourier Transform of the function E to the -
p T2,E if I want to use that notation for p S2,
 all right?
 The Fourier Transform of the Gaussian,
when it＊s normalized this way is itself.
 If you change the normalization,
a different answer, although,
 we＊ll figure out how to do that.
make such changes,
 but for this Gaussian the way it＊s normalized,
 E to the -p T2,
Fourier Transform is itself 每 quite remarkable,
 and quite important,
 all right,important.
Okay. All right. Now,
 that＊s about all I want to do at this stage for specific transforms.
We only have three,
 actually:
 the rectangle function,
 the triangle function,
Gaussian.
 There are other examples in the book,
 all right?
those.
 There＊s a one-sided exponential decay,
 the two-sided exponential decay.
gonna go through the calculations,
 all right?
 If this were a regular calculus class,
through all those calculations,
 but you＊re beyond that.
can certainly use the results,
 all right?
They all have to rely on using the definition of the Fourier Transform.
recourse.
 That＊s all you have to work with is the definition,
 all right?
you have at your disposal is 每 well,
 there are tricks like this,
 and then but, typically,
they＊re just integration techniques,
by substitution or integration by part; that＊s all that＊s use in any of those derivations,
right?
 So I＊ll let you go through those things,
 and certainly use the formulas.
reason to memorize them especially.
 I mean,them; they＊re there,
 and so on.
Instead,Fourier Transform.
 I mentioned there are two paths that we want to follow.
finding specific transforms,
the functions.
 So now I want to pursue that second path and look for general properties.
And the first one I want to look at often goes under the heading of duality.
explain that to you.
 It＊s actually very simple,
 but 每 Fourier Transform Duality,
 all right?
The formulas are extremely simple,
 but for some reason 每 well,
explain to you,
 many times students really agonize over these formulas,
 all right?
want to go through it in a little bit of detail.
Here,Transform and its inverse.
 That＊s what this is about,
Transform and the inverse Fourier Transform,
 okay?
write down the definition again.
 The Fourier Transform of F of S is the integral from -
to 8, E to the -2p I ST,
 F of T, DT, okay?
 Now,
function into another function,
 all right?
 To evaluate the transform,
a variable,
 and in this case,
 I＊m calling the variable S.
 Fine,the formula,
 and that tells me how to compute the Fourier Transform,
 fine.
What if I plug in -
S into the formula,
 all right?
S.
 The Fourier Transform is an operation that turns a function into another function,
to evaluate it,
 I have to plug in a point.
 I plug in the point -S.
 What do I get?
integral for -8 to 8 of E to the -2p I ℅ -ST,
 F of T, DT,
 which is the integral from -
of either the +2p I ST,
 F of T, DT,
 which is,
Fourier Transform,
 the inverse Fourier Transform of F at S.
I＊m gonna write that down one more time.
 Okay. 
The Fourier Transform of F at -inverse Fourier Transform of F at S.
 Fine, that＊s exactly what that formula says.
 Now,people,
 this gives some people just fits,
 all right?
 Why?
being wedded to an interpretation,
 all right?
 This is an example of 每 if it gives you fits,
it＊s because you＊re too wedded to an interpretation and wedded to your variables,
right?
Because they say how can it be S on both sides of the equation?
Transform,
 I get into the frequency domain.
 If I take the inverse Fourier Transform,
back into the time domain,
 but you＊re calling it S in both cases,
 man.
that? Are you allowed to do that?
 What kind of fool are you,
 man?It doesn＊t make sense,
 all right?
the idea that they cling to one particular interpretation.
domain.
 This Fourier Transform is something in the frequency domain.
the two in your head or anywhere,
 ever, all right?
And so this formula bothers people.
 You take the Fourier Transform evaluator minus,
the same thing as taking the inverse Fourier Transform,
 but I say to you,
when I was doing it,
 and that＊s why I was making the point,
formula,
 is an operation,
 that turns one function into another function.
To write down the formula,
 you have to evaluate the operation at a variable.
matter what I call the variable.
 I can it S.
 I can call it T.
 I can call it zippity do da.
call it anything,
 all right,
 as long as I am consistent,
 all right?
inconsistency; there is no error in this at all,
 all right?
 So don＊t think in terms of time,
frequency,
 or whatever.
 Think in terms of the mathematical operation.
Transform evaluate a -
S is the inverse Fourier Transform.
Now,
 there is a neater way of writing this.
 This statement actually and related statements,
which I＊ll show you now,
 are 每 and this is exactly sometimes called Duality,
Principle of Duality,
 or Duality for Fourier Transforms,
 or whatever.
tough time 每 this is an example,
 actually,notations, all right?
 If you used the capital letter notation,
 all right,domains, little f of t,
 capital F of S,
 you know?
down that formula in a way that really made sense,
 all right?
operational notation here or the operator notation,
 then it＊s easy to write down.
unambiguous,
 and there＊s no problem with it,
 all right?
Now, maybe, like I said,
 maybe you＊re looking at me like,
 ※What is the problem?
have any problem with this,
 but, trust me,interpreted.
 It＊s just a mathematical statement,
 all right?
statement as it turns out,
 but it is a mathematical statement.
time and frequency 每 not to my knowledge,
 all right?
Now, I＊m gonna write this another way,
 write more neatly.
good idea,
 I think,
 to try to write things in as variable a free way as you can,
 all right?
things pretty muddled,
 all right?
that will actually allow me to write the duality formulas without any variables,
there＊s,
 sort of,
 no agonizing, or perhaps, no agonizing.
So I want to introduce the reverse signal.
 As a matter of fact,
first homework,
 first or second homework,
 all right?
 That is if F of T is a signal,
define F - T just to be F of -T.
 All right.
 Not a big deal,
 all right.
want to think of T as time,
 you＊re reversing time; that＊s why I call it the reverse signal,
okay?
Then, first of all,
 it＊s a nice way of expressing evenness and oddness,
 actually,
terms of the reverse signal.
that F is even is to say that F of -
T is equal to F of T.
 So say if you reverse a signal,
get the same signal back again.
 F is odd,
 if you reverse the signal,
signal.
 Because F is odd,
 if F of -T is -F of T,
 all right?
 So it＊s a nice simple,
 let＊s say,
variable free way of writing it,
 if you want.
And what does this formula say; what does the duality formula say,
formula say?
 Once again,
 with variables,
 it says the Fourier Transform evaluated at -
equal to the inverse Fourier Transform of F evaluated at S,
 all right?
in a variable-
free way using the reversed signal.
evaluated at -S?
 It is the reverse of the Fourier Transform.
 Now,where I put the parenthesis.
reversed,
 evaluated at S is the Fourier Transform of F at -S,
 okay?
So this statement in a variable-
inverse Fourier Transform of F 每 kind of,
 nice. I mean,
Transform is the inverse Fourier Transform.
 That＊s why, in fact,
the Forward Fourier Transform and the Reverse Fourier Transform.
Actually,
 they don＊t even use the term transform and inverse.
the forward transform and the backwards transform or the reverse transform,
what they＊re often thinking about is this formula,
in there.of F.
Now, what about 每 so that＊s one form 每 I didn＊t do anything new there.
formula in a variable-
free way.
easily,
 to tell you the truth.
Let＊s look at something else.
 Let＊s look at the Fourier Transform of F-,
 the reverse signal,
all right?
 Notice the parentheses there,
 all right?
of F; I＊m taking the Fourier Transform of the reverse of F.
 What is this?
 Well,
evaluate this, I have to evaluate it at a point.
So the Fourier Transform of F-
 at S is, by definition,
 the integral for -here 
每 of E to the -2p I ST,
 F reversed FT, DT.Transform.formula.
 In this case it＊s F-,
 F reversed.
 This is the integral for -
8 to 8 of E to the -2p I,ST, F of -T, DT,
 by definition,
 right?Now,
 we＊re gonna work with that a little bit.
 We＊re gonna work with that last expression.
We＊re gonna make a change in variable.
 All right.
notation,
 all right?
can be a problem in this subject,
 all right?
 Finding your way through the notation,
making sure you＊re saying the right thing,
challenge.
 I have seen generations of students,
 very smart students, you know,
balled up over these points.
 So that＊s why I＊m doing them,
through correctly.
I＊m gonna make a change of variable.
 I＊m gonna let U = -T, all right?
 That＊s, sort of,
obvious thing to do here.
 I want to get rid of this F of -
T there,
change of variable in the integral,
 U = -T. So DU = -DT, okay?
integral?
 The integral from -
8 to 8 of E to the -
2p I ST,
 F of -T, DT,one step at a time,
 all right?
This is the integral of E to the -
2p I ST, so T = -U.
 So it＊s -2p I S -U, F of U, and DT -DU,
 all right?
 Then you have to change the limitave integration also,
 all right?
U = -T, and if T goes from -
8 to 8, then U goes from 8 to -8,
 all right?
to -8. Once again,
 if T goes from -
8 to +8,
 then -T goes from +8 to -8.
But so if that＊s the integral,
 either the 2p I SU,
 F of U, DU,sign out front,
 so it＊s minus the integral from 8 to -8.
integration.
 That becomes the integral for -
8 to 8, okay?
 What remains,
 dear friends?
What is that integral?
at S, okay?
What is the conclusion?
Fourier Transform.
 If I don＊t write the variable in there,
 all right?
of F reversed is the inverse Fourier Transform,
 all right?
 That＊s another duality theorem.
Now,had?
Fourier Transform of F reversed.
 That＊s this one over here,
 all right?
duality statement that I had.
 If I combine this one with this one,
statement.of F.
 That＊s the Fourier Transform of F reversed.
So just look at this one and this one.
 This is my favorite statement,
 actually,
statements ＆cause it＊s the easiest one for me to remember.
Transform. In words,
 it＊s so easy,
 and it＊s so nice.
signal is the reverse of the Fourier Transform,
 all right?
duality, all right?
There are no inverses in there.
 I short circuited by putting the inverse in the middle.
Fourier Transform of F reversed is the inverse Fourier Transform of F.
inverse Transform of F is the Fourier Transform of the reverse signal.
 See,these words fast enough,
 of course I say everything fast,
because I＊ve been through it a couple times,
 all right?
write my variables.
So you have this statement.
 That＊s another statement of duality.
 So, really,statement.
 There is the first statement that I have,
the inverse Fourier Transform of F,
 all right?
 We use this statement to get this statement.
There is one other formula 每 they＊re all basically the same.
that people often lump into,
 sort of, duality statements,
Transform of the Fourier Transform.
 Now, watch this; this is cute.
 One more,the Fourier Transform of the Fourier Transform of F,
 okay? Now,number of ways.
derivation,signal.
 You get back F reversed,
 okay?So you can derive this; you derive this.
we＊ve already shown over there.
 You can try to do it from scratch,
of the integral; don＊t worry about convergence or anything like that,
happens if you plug it into the definition.
And, again,frequency domain.
 That＊s not that that interpretation is wrong.
 I mean,want to think in terms of two domains.

 all right, not always.

 all right?
 It＊s just a statement.
thing is defined,
 all right?So,
 say, if you think that way,
formula,
 but there＊s certainly no inconsistency here.
your faith in the world,
and the frequency domain,
 you know, screw that.
 Excuse me. All right,
mathematical statement.
Now, these are very useful,
 all right?
 These come up a fair amount,
example; I＊ll give you a quick application,
 all right?
 Quick application,
actually finding Fourier Transforms,
 all right?
 So,
 for example,
Transform of the sync function,
 all right?
function is equal to the sync function.
sync function.
So we know 每 do it over here.
 Now, I do this,
 actually,
a slightly different way here,
 all right?
function is the sync function,
 all right?
the Fourier Transform of the Fourier Transform of a rectangle function,
 all right?
Fourier Transform of the rec 每 that＊s the first calculation we did.
the rec function is the sync function.
Fourier Transform of the Fourier Transform of the rec function,
Transform of the Fourier Transform of the rec function is,
 according to this formula,
reversal of the rec function,
 but the rec function is even,
 all right?
is an even function.
 So this is the rec function again.
 Lighting fast,
formula.Now,
 you would be hard pressed,
 all right,
issue is. If I were to say to you,
 ※Find the Fourier Transform of the sync function.
you were to say to me,
 ※I have only one recourse,
 and that is to the definition.
§ All right?
integral from -
8 to 8,
 E to the -2p I,
 ST, sign of pS ‾ pS 每 Oh,
 it＊s not a pT ‾ pT,
 DT.Good luck.
 All right?
 Good luck.

 I mean, and trying to evaluate this,
 and imagine,
 this evaluates to,
believe this,
 the function which is 1 from -.
 to . and 0 elsewhere, and 每 really?
 No. Oh,kidding?
 All right?
 You would be hard pressed,
 but the duality makes it easy,
 all right?
Now, like I said,
 this works because the rigor police are off duty,
 all right?
because I＊m assuming that there＊s actually no problem with the definitions,
formulas,
 and so on.
 That all the integrals work and so on.
takes some work to do this,
 all right? I mean,
 it is true.
 This statement is true,
Fourier Transform of the sync function is the rectangle function,
actually. I mean,
 we＊re gonna do it but, sort of,
 by indirection.But,
 nevertheless,
 with the rigor police off duty,
 and it＊s okay,
it works,Fourier Transform of the sync2 is the triangle function,
 same duality argument.
duality argument gives that the Fourier Transform of sync2 is the triangle function,
 okay?
Same thing.
 All right.
I tell you what.
 I usually keep you overtime.
 I think today,time because,
 god forbid, we get out early.
continue the discussion of general properties.
 I want to talk about the so-theorem,
 the shift theorem,
 and talk about convolution next time.
ahead a little bit,
of this, okay?
 See you on Wednesday.
