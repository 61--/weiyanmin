TheFourierTransformAndItsApplications-
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
I love show biz you know.
 Good thing. Okay.
 All right,
anything on anybody＊s mind out there?
 Any questions about anything?
enjoying our first problem set to class?
 I guess, Thomas posted some typos.those.
 I just had a chance to look at it this morning.
typo＊s in the problem set.
 So I＊ll look it over and repost the version of it.
there＊s anything there that would confuse anybody.
 All right? Okay.
where we finished up last time.

 So think in terms of sines and cosines,

So suppose we can write F of T as a sum,

 There was a question,

 So will give you essentially a sum of cosines.
 Okay?
Or sum of sines and cosines because the values are complex.
 And it＊s a symmetric sum.
Instead of going from one to N or zero to N,
minus N to N.apparent as we use it,
 all right? As I said before,
made incomparably easier by using complex exponentials than real sines and cosine＊.
Just the calculations become that much easier.
 All right.So, once again,
 suppose we can do this.

 So then the coefficients are given by C sub-

 where we just try to isolate the K coefficient and that certain way,

 This depended on a very important relationship of the complex exponentials.
This I＊ll write over here 每 oh,
 right here.
The interval from 每 I＊ll write it over here.

 say,

 So in that case I＊m just integrating to the zero,

 Fundamental relationship.
making its triumphant return a little later on.
 All right.Now,
 that＊s fine and that was a very important first step,
 but it was only the first step.
second step is to turn the question around,
 all right?
write the function in this form,
 then the coefficients have to be given by this formula.
second step is to turn that around and ask the following:
 When is that really possible?
I want to turn this around.
 So, again,
 you＊re given F of T periodic of period one,
 all right?
I know what the answer has to be,
 all right? In a sense,
to be.
 They have to be given by this,
 so I＊m gonna define them,
 all right?
Define 每 and I want to use a different notation.
that＊s quite standard in this subject.
 Define F hat of K to be this interval.

 KT, F of T, DT. So, again,
can compute this,
 all right?
 You＊re given F.

coefficient of F.
 What did we say?
 K four A coefficient,
 all right?
 So it depends on F and,
in fact,
 it can viewed as a transform of F,
 although we won＊t use that terminology 每 well,
useful when we talk about the Fourier transform.
 It＊s not the Fourier transform.
the Fourier coefficient.
So it＊s a transform of F,
 but evaluated on the integers.
 For each K,
number F hat of K given by this interval.
 And the question is,
the function?
 Can we sit beside the function in terms of its Fourier coefficients?
write F of T is the sum K equals minus N to N,
 F hat of K, E to the two pi I,N?
function in terms of these simple building blocks?
 That＊s the question.
 I say,the answer has to be if we can do it.
to involve this.
 That＊s what I talked about last time.
 The question is does it really work?
If it does,
power because,
 again,very simple terms.

and outputs given by the complex exponentials,

complex systems,
 simple building blocks.
 Not a great sentence here,
mean. Simple components,
 simple building blocks.
 I＊d like another try at that sentence,
but I think I＊d just rather leave it there,
 all right? Okay.Now,
 this method is only gonna be really helpful if it＊s fairly general.
been the question I＊ve raised a couple times.
 How general really is this?
we expect this to be if it works?
 All right.
we can handle an ad hoc basis when they came up.
 Well,here, all right?
 Let me show you the kind of things,
 not to be negative about it,
show you how high the stakes are,
 all right?
 This is a very high stakes question.
me do that by a couple of examples,
 all right?
Examples that are natural enough they can come up fairly easily in applications.
look at some examples of some of the kind of signals that could come up.
 For example,
you could take a signal that looks like this,
 all right?
 I＊ll draw it over here.
the graph.
 Something that looks like this.
off, zero or one,
 current is flowing or it＊s not flowing.
a second and then zero for half a second,
 all right?repeats.
 So one down to zero.
 One-half and then it repeats and it goes up,
 then it＊s on,then it＊s off,
 then it＊s on, then it＊s off,
 and so on and so on.
 Okay? So one, three halves,two,
 and so on and so on,
 all right?
negative numbers.
 That＊s a periodic function of period one,
 all right?half a second,
 off for half a second and repeats.
 All right.
 Can we expect to write,
call this F of T,
 all right?
 There＊s the graph,
 and I can write down the formula for it.
we write F in the form?
 I can compute the coefficients.
 I won＊t do it, but, in fact,
coefficients are calculated in the notes,
 all right?
 You can carry out the integration.
not a complicated interval to carry out.
interval from zero to a half.
 That＊s all of the function times a complex exponential.
you can compute easily F hat of K.
 F hat of K would be,
 in this case,
zero to a half.
 Let＊s say,
 I won＊t carry it out.
 E to the minus two pi I,
 KT times one DT,
all right?
 It＊s one on the interval from zero to a half and zero on the interval from one-
half to one.
 You only compute it on the interval on one period,
to one-half and that＊s an easy interval to figure out.
equals N to N,
 F hat of K, E to the two pi I, KT.
 That＊s the question.
 And the answer is,
no or at least not with a finite sum.
fundamental question only to answer it no for a relatively simple example.
is no, not for a finite sum. Why?
sines and cosines,
 all right?
 They＊re continuous.
continuous functions is continuous.
phenomenon.phenomenon, all right?
 You learned that theorem back in calculus,
 you know.
of a math teacher probably said something like and the sum of two continuous functions,
of course, is continuous.
 And you said, yeah, right.
 Okay, fine. What＊s the point? Well,
here＊s the point right now for the first time.
 This limits what you can do.
you might want to do.

 Bad luck, all right?
 Well,continuous at least,
 all right?
 But maybe has a corner.

 Let＊s say a triangle wave.
 Something that looks like this.
 Up, down, up, down,up, down, and so on.
 So on an interval from zero to one.
and, again, the power of these,
 along the negative axis also are for negative values of T.
So, again, we can easily compute the Fourier coefficients.
 That＊s not a problem.

 It＊s not a problem to carry out the integration and,

 that＊s done.

 you can compute the Fourier coefficients.

 Has to be integrated.
complex exponential plus the interval from one-
this is on the corresponding interval times the other times the complex interval.
can do it, all right?
 It requires a little bit of work,
 but it＊s not hard.
 You can do it.
Can we write,
 I＊ll call this F of T,
 again.
 My generic error function is always called F,
of T. Can we write, again,
 the corresponding sum?
 Sum K equals minus N to N,
F head of K,
 E to the two pi I KAT.
 And, again, the answer is no.
 Not for a finite sum.
Why? Well,
functions are differentiable then the sum of two functions is differentiable.
 And you said,
fine, fine, whatever.
 And it didn＊t seem to matter at the time,
this function is not differentiable.
 It has a corner,
 all right?

 They are differentiable.
 Their sum is differentiable.

differentiable function as a finite sum of differential functions.

 You just can＊t do it.
 The right-hand side is differentiable.
 The left-differentiable.
 Okay? Now,
 we could go on like this with more and more bad news,
right?
 That is,derivative, all right?
 There＊s a corner here.

the third derivative and so on and so on.
 If there is any lack of smoothness,

 no matter how smooth that corner looks,

 to use a technical term.
 All right?
Any discontinuity in any derivative includes writing F of T is this sum.

 E to the two pi I,
because these functions are infinitely differentiable.
they can be.
 They＊re sines and cosines.
cosines and put them together and get something that＊s not infinitely differentiable,
right?
 So this great idea 每 we might as well quit now or take the rest of the quarter off.
Because it doesn＊t look very general at all.
 I mean,against may have jumps,
 may have corners,
 may have discontinuities,
 whatever. All right.
can use this.
 And it＊s an argument,
accomplish here.
Let me, before I go any further,
 say that there＊s a maxim lurking here that＊s important,
right? That is,
or at least larger and larger finite sums.
 Sums of more and more terms.
that＊s lurking,
 and I＊ll say it now and then we＊ll go back to the general discussion,
it takes high frequencies to make sharp corners,
 or any corners for that matter.
it takes high frequencies to make sharp corners or really any kind of,
you say it like this,
 but really any kind of corner,
 all right?

representing that phenomenon as a finite sum.
larger to try to represent it more and more accurately.
 It takes more and more terms,
higher and higher frequencies to make that bend,
 all right?
degree of smoothness.
 All right?
 Now, by the way,
 you may think,
 again,artificial maxim that is,
 real signals don＊t have sharp corners,
 but that＊s not true.
 I mean,
all the time when you,
 and later when we talk about filtering,
sharp as you can is actually an important part of signal processing.

 Some of you,
 I＊m sure,
 have had some experience with this,
 all right?
Sometimes your signal starts out pretty smooth,
somehow less smooth.
with, all right?
with this maxim. All right.
 Now, like I said,
this grand general program that you＊ve been announcing?
can＊t consider finite sums to represent all but the most specialized phenomena,
any sum slight discontinuity in there at any level of smoothness,
this?
 And the come back to that is we have to consider infinite sums,
 all right?
To represent the general periodic phenomena,
infinite sums,
 all right?
 That＊s a mathematical point.
 As a practical matter,
 of course,
can＊t sum up an infinite series.
 You can only sum up an approximation,
might have to analyze,
your purview from finite sums to infinite sums.
phenomena we must consider infinite sums of the form,
 say,
half hat of K,
 E to the two pi I, KT.
 It may and be that not all these coefficients are nonzero.
 Some of them may be zero and so on,
you＊re gonna have non-
zero coefficients as far as you go out,
 all right?Any non-
smooth phenomenon signal will generate infinitely many,
many,
 but infinitely many Fourier coefficients,
 all right?
smooth, all right?
 Now, that＊s a problem,
 all right?
here because if you＊re gonna deal with an infinite sum mathematically,
applications,
 you have to talk about issues of convergence,
 all right?gonna be?
 If I cut it off after a finite number of terms,
 how accurate is it gonna be?
right?

But if the series is not converging and I still try to cut it off after a finite number of terms,
really want?
 So you have to deal with issues of convergence.
want this theory to apply at all generally.
 Okay? And, again,reasons,
 but also for practical reasons.
 Now, that＊s hard,
 all right?
hard questions here and we＊re not gonna go into the mathematical analysis of all of them.
I do want to give you a big picture.
news,
 but ultimately pretty good news,
sorted out.
working on this to finally resolve all these issues.
Why is this so 每 I mean,
 talking about convergence of series is hard anyway.
particularly hard in cases like this because the terms are oscillating,
 all right?
complex exponential,
 again,
 think in terms of sines and cosines,
 all right?
into its real and imaginary parts,
 sometimes the cosine is positive,
is negative,
 sometimes the sine is positive,
 sometimes the sine is negative.
positive terms and negative terms and adding infinitely many of them up,
 all right?
are going.

You need a conspiracy of cancellations,
 how about that?
because of the oscillation,
 all right?
 And that＊s hard to study.
a given case.
real.
 Now, here＊s what I want to do.
 I want to talk about the situation.
a number of statements,
 theorems that cover what the story is here.
 And, again,
going to go through the proofs of these things.
details.
 A lot of them are covered in the notes,
 not all of them, however,
little bit more about that as well.
what the answers are,
 all right?
So what I want to do is,
 I want to have a summary of the main results.
convergence when the function is continuous,
to know or,
 let me say, smooth.
 It has to be an infinite series if it＊s not infinitely smooth,
all right?
 The convergence,
 or what passes for convergence,
discontinuity,
 all right?
 These two cases are actually relatively straightforward.
to remember and it＊s easy to have a certain amount of confidence in what the results are,
again.
 Although, I won＊t prove it.
 I won＊t go through the proofs.
And,
 finally,
deep changes in the perspective that you have to adopt toward this circle of problems.
Convergence in general,
 all right?
that covers pretty much all situations that come up reasonably in practice.
time to sort out,
 all right?
 So this involves a fundamental change of perspective.
As said,
 I＊m not gonna do the tails,
tell you why.
 Because it has become so pervasive that is,
for studying convergence in general,
 even as it applies maybe to these simple situations,
has become so standard that you will see this in all the literature,
 all right?
the engineering literature,
 the terms that I＊m gonna use orthogonality,
convergence,
 L2, things like that.
 I＊ll say all those words and I＊ll tell you what they mean,
but it＊s become absolutely the way of talking about these things.
modern treatments of signal processing,
 and I＊m thinking,
 in particular,
limit analysis,
 which has become very popular in recent years.
exponentials as orthonormal basis.
this point of view.
 So I think,
 at least,
understanding and familiarity with the terminology that goes along with it,
 all right?
That＊s as far as I want to go with it.
 But even that I hope is gonna be helpful for you.
right.
 So let me look at these cases,
they＊re good to know.
 Convergence when the signal is continuous.
 Yes, good news.
converges, all right?
 So that is if 每 so continuous case,
 all right?
So, again,
 you can form the Fourier series,
 all right?
equals minus infinity to infinity,
 F hat of K,
 E to the two pi I,
the value F of T point Y.
it all up,
 then you have a series of constants,
 and what will it add up to?
the value of the function F of T.
 So that＊s good,
 all right?
then you know the series is gonna converge and it＊s gonna give you the right value,
right? Good.
 Not so easy to prove,
 all right?
 It takes a little work to prove that and,
 again,
that＊s sort of sketched out in the notes,
 all right?
 Not all the details,
 but a number of them.
You can at least see the broad outlines.
of abstraction in most mathematical books on Fourier analysis,
 Fourier series,
 all right?
But that＊s what to keep in mind there.
 So the continuous case is good.
 We call this point-
wise convergence,
 again, because you plug in a value of T,
 a point in time,
series,to the function F of T.
 In the case the function is smooth actually,more.
 If the function is differentiable,
 the smooth case.
degrees of differentiability.
 If it has one derivative,
 if it has two derivatives,
there＊s the question about are the derivative＊s continuous and so on,
split hairs on this.
 And, again,
 there＊s a fairly precise statement that＊s given in the notes,
but it says this.
 So if it＊s smooth and the particulars continuous,
converges.
So, again, the series converges,
 the Fourier series,
hat of K,
 E to the two pi I,
 KT converges to F of T.
case, but there＊s actually more to it than this that,
 again,
you＊re trying to estimate errors.
control the rate at which the series converges.
 Same rate for different values of T.
 So,again,
 without trying to make it 每 I can make this precise,
requires too much notation.
 So you can i.e.
 think of it this way,
 you can control,
can estimate,
 the rate of convergence,
 how fast the series is converging.
Add different values of T depending on the degree of smoothness.
is you get estimates on the size of the coefficients,
between the function,
 and a finite approximation,
 a finite version of the series,
on the smoothness,
 all right?
 The smooth of the function is the faster it converges.
one way of looking at it.
 And, again,
 without giving a technical definition of it.
 Yeah?
Student:
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Well, what the uniform convergence means roughly and,
again,
things like that,
 is if this is the function,
 all right? All right?
 It＊s periodics, or the pattern,
repeats.
approximation,
 so if you look at a finite version of the sum just going from minus N to N,
then that will track.
 So this is F of T,
 all right?
 That＊s the original function.
approximation does something like,
 you know,
 it tracks the function along the way.
is [inaudible] sum,
 all right?
approximation is from the function,
 all right?
So instead of just saying at a particular point the series is converging,
 all right?
 So, again,
value of the function.
 That＊s fine.
 That＊s what happens for the continuous case.
smooth case,
 you can say more than that.
approximation is to the function over the entire interval,
 over all from zero to one,
right?
 And you can give an estimate for that,
 all right?
for you,
 all right?
 And, again,
 you could write that down precisely,
that.
There is actually a statement of this theorem that＊s given in the notes,
 if you＊re interested.
And it＊s interesting.
 I mean, and, again,
you＊re never gonna work with an infinite series in practice.
with a finite approximation.
 So the question is can you estimate the error?
upon,
 can you give some reasonable estimate for how far off you are?
 Not just at a point,
but uniformly over the interval where you＊re interested in making the approximation.
it can come up.
 So you have uniform estimate of the closeness.
 Okay? All right.
So that＊s the continuous case and the smooth case.
 So that＊s good news,
 all right?
good news.
 That＊s nice.
 If the function is continuous the series are converging.
function is smooth the series is converging and it actually,
 sort of,
to the given function.
 Now, I want to jump back,
 actually,
know about and that＊s when you have a jump discontinuity.
 And, again,prove this,
problems that use it,
 or a problem that uses it.
 So if you have a jump discontinuity,
functions can fail to be continuous in a lot of different ways.
showed.
So the example of a switch where it＊s on,
 then off, all right?
 Something like this,
right?
 Where the signal jumps down or up.
 Okay? So EG.
 And there the theorem is,
is if a T knot is a point of jump discontinuity,
 this is a really cool result actually.
this converges,
 then the sum minus infinity to infinity 每 well,
 yeah.
 I＊ll put it like this.
Minus two pi I,
 KT,
 sorry, sorry, sorry.
 F hat of K,
 the Fourier series, F hat of K,
two pi I,
 KT does converge at T knot.
 It converges at the jump discontinuity,
function doesn＊t really have a value of T knot,
 because it jumps.
 But it converges,
actually,
 to the average value,
 all right?
jump,
 to the average of the jump i.
e.
 to one-
half 每 let me write it like this one-
knot.
 This is usually the way it＊s written.
 F of T knot plus F of T knot minus,
 all right?
So what I mean by that is you＊re approaching T knot from the left,
minus,
 it has this value.
 You approach F of T knot from the right it has this value,
of T knot plus,
 all right?
average of the jump,
 right in the middle,
 that＊s what it converges to,
 all right?
cool.
 And this wasn＊t proved until,
 I think,
 the 1900＊s,
1900＊s.
struggling with a lot of these problems.
applications.
 So, for example,
 for the saw tooth,
 or not the saw tooth,
periodic signal here,
converges to one-half, all right?
So even sometimes people define this function to be one on the interval from zero to one-half,
 leaving out one-half.
 One-half at the discontinuity and zero from here to here,
 right?
You sometimes see that definition given.
definition is because they want to anticipate this result.
series,
 they say that that,
 you know, it＊s, sort of,
function in consistent with the property of the convergence of the Fourier series.
not so easy to prove,
 all right?
 None of these things are really easy to prove.
lot of work,
 all right?
 It requires a lot of estimates and careful analysis,
 but it＊s nice.
very satisfying in some sense that it tells you 每 at least you know what the situation is.
I＊m not saying it＊s easy to establish,
 but at least you know what the facts are,
 all right?
That＊s good. That＊s good. Okay?
So any questions on that?
 This should be,
 sort of,
 part of your vocabulary.
 Yeah?
Student:
[Inaudible] continuity?
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Then that＊s not a jump discontinuity,
 all right?
by jump discontinuity,
 I mean it jumps between two finite values.
 Okay? Yeah.
trying to avoid 每 I mean,
 I＊m talking to you in a somewhat informal way.
avoid giving very precise definitions to all these things because you,
 sort of,
when you see it,
 all right?
 You can do that,
 of course.
statements here about the uniformity of approximation,
 about how it converges,on,
 but that＊s not so crucial for us.
picture is. Yeah?
Student:
[Inaudible] point that ever function with jumps,
there are no jumps?
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Sorry?
Student:
What about point where there are no jumps?
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
All right.
 What about points where there are no jumps?
 So,actually, perhaps,
continuous case.
converges at any point of continuity,
 all right?
 So if a function 每 if it doesn＊t jump,
continuous at that point then the series converges at that point.
 Okay?
actually be a more precise statement of it.
 Oh,
 I better not stop asking for questions here,
all right?
 As I say,
precise as I can.
 I can do that,
 but you don＊t want to see that.
 All right.
And, again,
 don＊t underestimate the effort that it took to do this,
 all right?
first came out with his ideas and we＊ll see that his original application,
 actually,
Monday.
 He was very bold.
 He actually said any function,
 not just any periodic function,
because he was thinking of extending a function to be periodic by just repeating it,
know.
 He was thinking of functions,
 which die ff and then repeating it.
statements like any function can be represented by such an infinite series.
were scandalized by that,
scandalized.
 Bonjour, any function,
 you are a fool, monsieur.
sort these things out.
much.
 But now,
sights very high.
 But any periodic phenomena,
 never mind smoothness,
 whatever,
be represented in some sense by a Fourier series,
 by this sort of infinite sum.
that out and to get to the truth of that really required an entirely different perspective.
wanted to say a little bit about that.
Monday,
 and then we＊ll see some applications of this,
 all right? All right.
So general case.
 That is not talking about continuity,
 not talking about smoothness,
so on, all right?
 In here,
 what＊s really involved is you need,
 we learned after decades,
centuries of bitter experience,
series.
 You learn not to talk about what you think would be the most natural thing,
 point- wise convergence,
 all right?
 You learned by hard lessons.
work.
 I mean,
 ultimately you couldn＊t get an answer that was very satisfying.
cases we＊re fine,
 but somehow under natural and fairly general situations,
to ask for convergence of a sum like this,
there.
 Cease of K,
 E to the two pi I, KTM.
 Even for general series,
 all right?
You learn not to ask for convergence of that at particular points.
 At values of T, all right?
and asking whether or not converged,
 all right?
 And that was a hard step to take.
 Rather,convergence in the mean,
 convergence on average.
 I mean,point of view.
 So you get a better picture,
 more satisfying picture,
convergence in the average sense or also sometimes called convergence in the mean,
I will write that down,
 all right?
In engineering terms it＊s also sometimes called convergence in energy.
term for reasons,
 which I＊ll explain,
 probably not today,
 but next time. Okay?
me.
 All right. Now,
 what does that mean?
 Well,the function, all right?
arbitrary,
 but the assumption you make on the function is pretty minimal.
 So, again,
assuming the function＊s periodic.

for us because everything is just repeated after that,
 all right?
So, I suppose, again,
 F of T is periodic period one,
 periodic period one,
suppose that it has the following property.
 That the interval 每 it＊s square interval.
DT is fine.
a thing to insist on.
 It＊s not too restrictive a thing to insist on.

 if it＊s unbounded,
 then it may not satisfy this.
a little bit more later.
 Take this interval,
function depending on what the function represents.
somehow the signal has finite energy,
 which is a reasonable physical assumption,
right?Finite energy.
 All right.
 Then as it turns out,
do exist.
question of integrability,
 but it＊s true.
integral from zero to one,
 E to the minus two pi I,
 KT as before,
 F of T, DT, all right?
Again,
assuming the function is continuous or anything else,
 but it can be done.
line is,
 and it＊s quite a punch line,
 that you still get convergence of the series,
infinite Fourier series,
 but not 每 and this board is floating up here.
 Let me do it over here.
But not by plugging in points,
 but rather in an average sense as follows.
So then I＊ll write it like this.
 The interval from zero to one.
the function is to an approximating series,
 so that means a finite version of the sum.
the sum,
 the interval of the sum from K equals minus N to N of F hat of K,
pi I,
 KT minus F of T squared,
 DT, all right?
difference between a finite approximation of the sum,
 makes perfect sense to form that,
and the function.
 And the statement is that this tends to zero as N tends to infinity,
right?
 The series converges of the function in the average sense.
the function in the mean,
 all right?
you 每 one second.
 The idea of integrating the square,
 or the difference of the squares,
also probably more or less more familiar to you and,
 as a matter of fact,
 this is exactly,
again,
 for reasons I can＊t explain today,
of a function by a combination of complex exponentials.
 Now,
 you had a question?
Student:
[Inaudible] convergence in the mean square?
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Pardon me?
Student:
Is this mean square convergence?
Instructor (Brad Osgood):
Yeah.
 Mean square convergence,
 thank you.
convergence to the mean,
 maybe I should even call it mean square convergence.
familiar with that term by all means use it,
 all right?
 So it＊s mean square convergence.
right.
 So the result is 每 that I＊m afraid we＊ll have to quit for today.
series converges to the function,
 right? That is,
 it makes sense to write,
equals it＊s Fourier series,
 K equals minus infinity to infinity,
 F hat of K, E to the two pi I,
KT,
 but you have to understand what this equal sign means,
 all right?
 In this context,
right?
In this context you have to be careful here what this equal sign means.
pluck value of T and watch the series converge to the value of the function.
mean that.
to infinity here,
 then that interval will tend to zero.
to zero.
 That＊s what that equal sign means,
 all right?
a finite approximation tends to zero as the approximation gets better and better.
square,
 interval to square.
Now, that was a big change of view,
 all right?
that notion of equality,
 that notion of convergence,
 and so on.
reaching consequences,
 all right?
 And, again,
 it took a long time to sort out.
out of time for today,
 so I can＊ tell you that.
 So on Monday I want to wrap this up.
all the mathematical details,
you＊re gonna see it beyond this class.
 You＊re gonna see people use this terminology,
these ideas well beyond what we do in here,
 and it＊s really quite satisfying.
quite thorough and satisfying coherent picture,
 all right?
 So more on that on Monday.
