00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,097
TheFourierTransformAndItsApplications-Lecture04 Instructor (Brad Osgood):

2
00:00:20,097 --> 00:00:23,066
 All right,

3
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,419
 so today I have two things in mind today.

4
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:29,734
 I want to wrap up our discussion of some of the theoretical aspects of Fourier series.

5
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:31,669
 We¡¯re skimming the surface on this a little bit,

6
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:32,620
 and it really, you know,

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,106
 kind of kills me because it¡¯s such wonderful material and it really is important in its own way.

8
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:39,532
 But as I¡¯ve said before and now you¡¯ll hear me say again,

9
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:44,399
 the subject is so rich and so diverse that sometimes you just have to,

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,728
 you can¡¯t go into any ¨C if you went into any one topic,

11
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:50,864
 you could easily spend most of the quarter on it and it would be worthwhile,

12
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,609
 but that would mean we wouldn¡¯t do other things which are equally worthwhile.

13
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,417
 And so it¡¯s always a constant trade-off.

14
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,365
 It¡¯s always a question of which choices to make.

15
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:58,019
 So again,

16
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:01,203
 there are more details in the notes than I¡¯ve been able to do in class,

17
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:02,680
 and will be able to do in class,

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,641
 but I do want to say a few more things about it today.

19
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:05,857
 That¡¯s one thing.

20
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:10,605
 And the second thing is I want to talk about an application to heat flow 

21
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:15,170
that¡¯s a very important application historically,

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,348
 certainly and it also points the way to other things 

23
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:19,162
that we will be talking about quite a bit as the course progresses.

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,650
 All right, so let me wrap up and again,

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:30,338
 some of the sort of the theoretical size of things.

26
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:31,588
 And I¡¯ll remind what the issue is that we¡¯re studying,

27
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:33,113
 and so this is our Fourier series fine, all right?

28
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:47,124
 Last time we talked about the problem in trying to make sense out of infinite sums,

29
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:50,689
 infinite Fourier series,

30
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,682
 and the important thing to realize is that that¡¯s not by no means the exception,

31
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:54,364
 all right?

32
00:01:54,364 --> 00:02:10,622
 We want to make sense of infinite sums of complex exponentials sum from K equals Minus Infinity,

33
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:13,484
 Infinity, cK, either the 2 pi, KT.

34
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,867
 I'm thinking of these things as Fourier coefficients,

35
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,177
 but the problem is general.

36
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,019
 How do you make sense of such an infinite sum?

37
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,960
 And the tricky thing about it is that if you think in terms of sines and cosines,

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,365
 these functions are oscillating. All right,

39
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,541
 everything here in sight is a complex number and complex functions,

40
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,417
 but think in terms of the real functions,

41
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,210
 sines and cosines where they¡¯ oscillating between positive and negative,

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,374
 so for this thing to converge,

43
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,987
 there¡¯s got to be some sort of conspiracy of cancellations that making it work.

44
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:38,676
 Of course,

45
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:41,808
 the size of the coefficients is going to play a role as it always does 

46
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,129
when you study issues of convergents.

47
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,157
 But it¡¯s more than that because the function is bopping around from positive to negative,

48
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:48,104
 see,

49
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:50,150
 all right and that makes it trickier to do.

50
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,768
 That makes it trickier to study. And again,

51
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:57,047
 realize that this is by no means the exception,

52
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:01,545
 and so in particular if F of T again is periodic,

53
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,019
 period 1,

54
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:15,975
 we want to write with some confidence that it¡¯s equal to its Fourier series.

55
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:20,272
 We want to write with some confidence,

56
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:25,190
 at least we want to know what we¡¯re talking about,

57
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,497
 that F of T,

58
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:35,519
 say is equal to its Fourier series going from minus [inaudible] 2 p i KT,

59
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,369
 and again,

60
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:44,936
 it¡¯s really if you want to deal with any degree of generality,

61
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,903
 it¡¯s going to be the rule rather than the exception 

62
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:52,283
that you¡¯ll have an infinite sum because any small lack of smoothness in the function

63
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:55,718
 or in any of its derivatives is gonna force an infinite number of terms.

64
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,935
 A finite number of terms,

65
00:03:56,935 --> 00:04:01,811
 a finite of trigometric sum will be infinitely smooth.

66
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,538
 The function and all its derivatives will be infinitely differentiatable,

67
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:07,076
 so if there¡¯s any discontinuity in any derivative you can¡¯t have a finite sum.

68
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:19,029
 So any lack of smoothness forces an infinite sum,

69
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,743
 again,

70
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:24,635
 so it¡¯s not because the method is trumpeted as being so general,

71
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:28,952
 you have to face the fact that you¡¯re dealing with an infinite number of terms here,

72
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,431
 all right? Now, by the way,

73
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:34,691
 I don¡¯t mean to say that all the terms are necessarily non-

74
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,213
zero,

75
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:36,711
 that all the coefficients are necessarily non-

76
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,201
zero. That¡¯s not true. Some of the terms may be zero.

77
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:42,421
 For example, when you have certain symmetries,

78
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:45,779
 the even coefficients may be zero or the odd coefficients may be zero and in special cases,

79
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,443
 or a finite number may be zero or a block of them may be zero.

80
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:49,950
 You don¡¯t know exactly what¡¯s gonna happen.

81
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,015
 But all I'm saying is you can¡¯t resort to only a finite sum if there¡¯s any lack of smoothness in there.

82
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:57,290
 All right, so again, that¡¯s the issue. Yeah.

83
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,176
 Student:[Inaudible]. Instructor (Brad Osgood):

84
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:01,938
Does [inaudible] of K,

85
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:04,509
 that actually is a K although it looks like a T,

86
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,112
 it¡¯s [inaudible]. All right, the K Fourier coefficient.

87
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:09,541
 I¡¯ll remind you what the definition is since we¡¯re gonna use that.

88
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:16,773
 So [inaudible] of K is the integral as a K,

89
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:21,329
 integral from 0 to 1 of either the minus 2 pi KT,

90
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,909
 F of T DT. Is somebody¡¯s phone ringing? All right,

91
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:33,010
 now, so last time we dealt with, at least in statement,

92
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,397
 the cases where that function was smooth or is smooth and 

93
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:37,733
you get all that nice sort of convergents that you want.

94
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,174
 All right, so F of T is continuous,

95
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:51,261
 smooth or even if you have a jump continuity,

96
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:53,125
 then you get the sort of kind of convergents that you want.

97
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,820
 You get satisfactory convergents.

98
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,346
 I¡¯ll just leave it at that because the precise statement we talked about last time,

99
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:00,233
 and it¡¯s also in the notes,

100
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:06,774
 you get satisfactory convergents results.

101
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:07,596
 So that¡¯s fine, so again,

102
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:09,567
 that gives you a certain amount of confidence that you write the series down,

103
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:15,287
 you can manipulate it and plug into it and things like that and nothing terrible is gonna happen.

104
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,654
 But to deal with a more general functions,

105
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,689
 the more general signals that arise,

106
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:23,167
 it really requires a different point of view,

107
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:23,922
 all right,

108
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,333
 greater generality requires a different point of view,

109
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,291
 and that¡¯s where we finished up last time.

110
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:32,226
 Now, it¡¯s not just for fun, even for mathematical fun.

111
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,438
 That is,

112
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,171
 this point of view turns out to have far-

113
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:39,052
reaching consequences and really does frame a lot of the understanding and discussion,

114
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:40,309
 not only for Fourier series,

115
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:46,908
 but other subjects that are very similar and also in sort of everyday use in a lot of fields of signal processing.

116
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:56,912
 So very generality requires a different point of view,

117
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:58,032
 different terminology,

118
00:06:58,032 --> 00:06:59,785
 different language and a whole sort of re-

119
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:06,044
orientation. All right, and again, I set that up last time,

120
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:08,015
 and I'm gonna remind you where we finished up and 

121
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:13,486
I wanna put in one more important aspect of it today and that¡¯s all we¡¯re gonna do,

122
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:16,219
 sad to say, all right? So again,

123
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,489
 the condition is the integrability of all things.

124
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:21,272
 Instead of smoothness, instead of differentiability,

125
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:25,291
 the condition that turns out to be important is integrability to function.

126
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:37,326
 All right, the important condition, and a relatively easy one to verify,

127
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:41,184
 integrability, all right? So you say that a function,

128
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:48,896
 say that F of T is squared integrable or briefly,

129
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:53,022
 you say that F is in L2 of the integral from 0 to 1.

130
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,080
 I'm only working on an integral from 0 to 1 here.

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,046
 And L2 stands for square,

132
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:58,722
 well the 2 stands for square and the L stands for Lebeg,

133
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,981
 and I¡¯ll say a little bit more about that in a second if the integral is finite,

134
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:06,725
 integral of the square is finite, F of T DT is less than ¨C

135
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,788
 I want to allow complex value functions here,

136
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,310
 although many of the applications are real,

137
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,742
 but I want to allow complex value functions,

138
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,226
 so I put the absolute value of F of T squared there,

139
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,872
 all right? That¡¯s an easy condition to satisfy.

140
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:22,419
 Physically one encounters this condition in the context of this integral representing energy and 

141
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,814
so one also says that this signal has finite energy.

142
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:31,392
 That¡¯s another way of saying it, and you see that terminology.

143
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:40,583
 All right? So if you have a periodic function,

144
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:45,316
 which is integrable, like so, all right,

145
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:56,040
 so again if F of T is periodic and square integrable,

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:03,726
 then you form the Fourier coefficients and they exist actually the square integrability is enough to imply that the Fourier coefficients exist.

147
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:10,870
 Then your form, [inaudible], as before, either the minus 2 pi I,

148
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:20,249
 KT F of T DT and the sum converges the infinite Fourier series is equal to the function in the sense of mean square convergents.

149
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:24,253
 And you have, and this is the fundamental result,

150
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:29,695
 that the integral from 0 to 1 of the difference between the function and 

151
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:38,182
the finite approximation between the function,

152
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:39,291
 the square of the difference,

153
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,207
 the integral of the square of the difference,

154
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,054
 this tends to 0 as N tends to infinity.

155
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,680
 Takes up the entire board and it deserves to.

156
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,948
 All right, it¡¯s an important result, okay?

157
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:53,320
 Okay,

158
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,941
 now I really feel like have to say a little bit more here,

159
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,126
 but only a little bit more.

160
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:04,174
 The fact is you only get these wonderful convergents results

161
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,383
 if you not only generalize your point of view towards convergents,

162
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,181
 but you also have to generalize the integral.

163
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:10,212
 All right, this actually only holds for ¨C

164
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:15,455
 the whole circle of ideas really only holds for a generalization of the [Inaudible] integral.

165
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:18,312
 Do you have to worry about this? No. All right.

166
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:29,559
 But the fact is, you only get these convergence results,

167
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,413
 such convergence results.

168
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:36,653
 You can only really prove them in the slightly more general context of integration.

169
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:40,299
 Convergence results,

170
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:52,390
 if you use a generalization of the integral even,

171
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,562
 which is a whole other subject due to Lebeg,

172
00:10:55,562 --> 00:11:00,470
 and that¡¯s what the L stands for in L2, due to Lebeg.

173
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,871
 It¡¯s a French mathematician in the turn of the 20th Century,

174
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:09,855
 who actually in the context of these sorts of applications,

175
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:14,027
 trying to extend integration,

176
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:19,494
 trying to extend limiting processes to more general circumstances where they couldn¡¯t prove the results classically,

177
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:20,442
 mathematicians were worried about this,

178
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,086
 he had a more general definition of the integral.

179
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,684
 And with that more general,

180
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,865
 more flexible definition of the integral,

181
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,525
 the limiting processes are easier to handle.

182
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,348
 You can do more than you¡¯d like to do,

183
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:29,884
 but somehow don¡¯t feel justified in doing,

184
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:31,798
 and in that context,

185
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:33,586
 this is something you don¡¯t have to know about,

186
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:40,191
 all right. But he generalized the integral only,

187
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,388
 and by doing so,

188
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,137
 it was perfectly suited to solving these sorts of problems.

189
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,452
 It was really a quite compelling case. It was really a beautiful theory,

190
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:48,744
 but, you know, it¡¯s a famous quote.

191
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:53,434
 The usual integral that you studied when you studied integrals in Calculus is called the [inaudible] integral.

192
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,005
 All right,

193
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,012
 and that suffices for just about every application,

194
00:11:56,012 --> 00:12:00,279
 but there are more general integrals. On the other hand,

195
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,806
 John Tukey who was a famous applied mathematician was quoted as saying,

196
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:09,654
 ¡°I certainly don¡¯t want to fly in an airplane whose design depended on whether to function as a remount integral or a Lebeg integrable.

197
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:13,529
 That¡¯s not the point.¡± All right, the point really is a theoretical one,

198
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,849
 not a practical one. But nevertheless,

199
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:21,676
 somehow honesty compels me to say what¡¯s involved here.

200
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:22,206
 All right,

201
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:25,635
 so it¡¯s in that sense that you had to talk about convergents,

202
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:29,697
 and it¡¯s not an unreasonable condition, all right,

203
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:32,021
 that is also called, as I said last time,

204
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,771
 convergents in energy,

205
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,436
 convergents in the mean or mean squared convergents.

206
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:40,618
 And what that means is on average this sum is converging to the functional and average in the sense

207
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:44,137
 that if you look at the difference between the function and finite approximation,

208
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:45,190
 square that,

209
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,509
 integrate it and integrating is sort of taking an average and then that tends to zero as [inaudible] infinity.

210
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,641
 It¡¯s approximating over the entire interval on average 

211
00:12:53,641 --> 00:13:04,394
rather than concentrating its efforts instead of approximating it at a single point.

212
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:06,464
 And again, you will,

213
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:10,511
 if you look at the literature and I'm talking about the engineering literature,

214
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,740
 you¡¯ll see these terms all the time. You¡¯ll see L2 all the time.

215
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,082
 As a matter of fact, actually, if you take,

216
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,106
 some of you have probably had courses in quantum mechanics and 

217
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,947
if you take it all sort of an advanced course in quantum mechanics,

218
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:25,753
 not that I ever have, but if you do,

219
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:30,947
 it¡¯s also framed very much in the context of L2 [inaudible] spaces and things like that,

220
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,740
 [inaudible] spaces and L2 spaces and so on.

221
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,508
 It¡¯s not, I'm not making this up. It really is ¨C

222
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:41,269
 it has become the sort of framework for a lot of the discussion.

223
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,443
 If you want to be sure that you have some certain amount of confidence in applying mathematical formulas,

224
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:53,221
 you need the right kind of general framework to put them in and this is for many problems,

225
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:56,594
 exactly that. Now, there is one further aspect of it,

226
00:13:56,594 --> 00:14:00,049
 and that¡¯s as far as I'm gonna go,

227
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,122
 that brings back that fundamental property of the complex exponentials

228
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:06,127
 that we used to solve the Fourier coefficients.

229
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,211
 So I want to highlight that now.

230
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:17,334
 So remember in solving for the Fourier coefficients way back when,

231
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:24,575
 I mentioned this last time and I wanted to bring it back now in a more general context again,

232
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:32,185
 in solving for the Fourier coefficients we used a simple integration fact that it was actually everything.

233
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:36,352
 It was essential that either the 2 pi,

234
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:40,613
 NT times the [inaudible] minus 2 pi MT DT so that we can combine those complex exponentials,

235
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:48,977
 that¡¯s either the 2 pi and minus MT was equal to zero if M is different from N.

236
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:52,731
 If M is equal to N, then it¡¯s equal to 1,

237
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:59,626
 all right? That simple fact, that simple calculus fact emerges ¨C

238
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:06,959
 turns out to be the cornerstone for understanding these spaces of square integral function ¨C

239
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:16,015
 if we¡¯re introducing geometry into those spaces.

240
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:21,184
 So this simple observation, simple fact,

241
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:28,269
 is a cornerstone for introducing, if I can say it that way,

242
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,990
 introducing ¡°Geometry,

243
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,276
¡± I put it in quotes because it¡¯s geometry like you don¡¯t even think of geometry,

244
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,340
 but the features are there by analogy.

245
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,932
 Geometry into the space into square integral functions,

246
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:46,970
 L2 01. And when I say introduce geometry,

247
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,254
 again I'm reasoning by analogy here, although it¡¯s a very powerful analogy.

248
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,096
 And the thing that makes geometry,

249
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:57,535
 geometry as far as Euclid is concerned is the notion of no perpendicularity.

250
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,106
 All right,

251
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:03,795
 that¡¯s one of the most important notions of geometry and that¡¯s exactly what gets carried over here.

252
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,273
 It allows you,

253
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:11,888
 it allows one to define orthogonality or perpendicularity,

254
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:25,412
 same word, same thing, all right, via inner product or dot product.

255
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:26,866
 All right, so let me give you the definition.

256
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,739
 I'm not gonna justify it because there¡¯s justification in the book actually,

257
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:38,051
 in the notes. But it looks like this,

258
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:47,295
 so again if F and G are square integrable functions and I'm gonna assume they¡¯re complex,

259
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,646
 there¡¯s a little distinction here between what happens in the real case and what happens in the complex case,

260
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:54,472
 square integrable on 01, as always, that¡¯s the basic assumption we make.

261
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:59,953
 Then you define they¡¯re inner product

262
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:17,324
 which is a generalization of the usual dot product for vectors a generalization of the dot product for vectors,

263
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:33,381
 by an integral formula, all right, it¡¯s defined by FG and you¡¯re right,

264
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,758
 there are various notations for it,

265
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,459
 but the common notation is just to put them in a pair,

266
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:40,830
 or sometimes people will write them with angled brackets or sometimes people do all sorts of things.

267
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,850
 Sometimes physicists call it, you know,

268
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,215
 [inaudible] vectors and [inaudible] vectors and all sorts of bizarre,

269
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:52,795
 unnatural things. But I¡¯ll take the simplest notation,

270
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:53,790
 so zero to one,

271
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,623
 F of T times G of T bar complex conjugate DT.

272
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:00,538
 That¡¯s because I'm allowing the complex value of functions.

273
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,451
 If G of T were a real value of function,

274
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:04,119
 then I would just have F times integral or F times G 

275
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,477
because it¡¯s complex for reasons which again are explained a little bit better in the notes.

276
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:11,029
 You put the complex conjugate in there. Now,

277
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,949
 what you have to believe is that

278
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:17,780
this is sort of a continuous infinite dimensional generalization of the [inaudible] of two vectors.

279
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,451
 How do you take the [inaudible] of two vectors?

280
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:20,828
 You multiply the components together,

281
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:22,942
 the corresponding components together and add,

282
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:24,187
 all right?

283
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,500
 So it¡¯s like you¡¯re multiplying the values together,

284
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,726
 although the function times the conjugate of the other function,

285
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,610
 those are the values, and you¡¯re adding,

286
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,158
 but continuously in the sense of taking the integral instead of the sum,

287
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,798
 all right? That¡¯s sort of where it comes from.

288
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:40,994
 Now, that¡¯s fine,

289
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,553
 but the real benefit is it allows you to define if you ever want to do that,

290
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,871
 when two vectors, when two functions are perpendicular.

291
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:56,202
 So you say that F and G are orthogonal, you could say they¡¯re perpendicular,

292
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,875
 but it sounds ever so more mathematical if you say they¡¯re orthogonal,

293
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:05,244
 all right. Orthogonal and if you write it neatly ¨C

294
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,705
 orthogonal, much neater. If they¡¯re in a product,

295
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:15,029
 it¡¯s 0, if FG is equal to 0 period ¨C that¡¯s a definition,

296
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,049
 all right. That¡¯s a definition. Now, where does the definition come from,

297
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,200
 again, you know,

298
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,961
 because I can¡¯t say everything as much as I¡¯d like to,

299
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,003
 let me refer to the notes,

300
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:26,174
 because it¡¯s actually not so unreasonable.

301
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:30,908
 This definition comes from the exactly wanting to satisfy the Pythagorean theorem or inner products.

302
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,001
 Now,

303
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:42,846
 the calculation we do with the complex exponentials shows exactly the different complex exponentials are orthogonal.

304
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:46,998
 One more thing actually,

305
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:53,342
 let me introduce the length of a function or the norm of a function in terms of the inner product,

306
00:19:53,342 --> 00:20:00,078
 or in terms of the integral, same thing.

307
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:04,751
 So the norm of F, norm of a function F,

308
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:09,747
 is defined by the square of a norm is just the inner product of the function of itself,

309
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:12,845
 just like the square of the length of a vector is the inner product of a vector with itself.

310
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:19,224
 So the inner product of F with itself is the norm of F squared and that¡¯s the notation you use,

311
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,763
 and so what is that; that¡¯s exactly ¨C

312
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:31,069
 so the norm of F squared is exactly the integral from 0 to 1 of F of T squared DT.

313
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,996
 And let me just tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is then.

314
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:38,900
 All right, the Pythagorean theorem is ¨C I¡¯ll do it over here,

315
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,177
 because that¡¯s where this comes from.

316
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:47,987
 That¡¯s exactly where this definition comes from and that¡¯s exactly where the property comes from.

317
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:54,550
 The Pythagorean theorem is exactly this,

318
00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:13,724
 that F is orthogonal to G if and only if the norm of F plus G squared is equal to the norm of F squared plus the norm of G squared and 

319
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:24,783
that is if and only if the inner product is 0.

320
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:34,293
 Why is that the Pythagorean theorem ¨C because of vector addition,

321
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:47,265
 all right? If I wrote vectors, U and V, then this is the vector U plus V,

322
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:47,872
 all right,

323
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,522
 if I just write vectors and the Pythagorean theorem says,

324
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:55,497
 ¡°The square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the sides for right triangle and only for right triangle.

325
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:56,923
¡± That characterizes the right triangle, all right.

326
00:21:56,923 --> 00:22:01,648
 So that says the norm of U plus V squared,

327
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:05,020
 the square of the length of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the other two sides,

328
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,068
 U squared plus V squared,

329
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:10,838
 and that holds only exactly when the two vectors are perpendicular and that¡¯s 

330
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:15,683
where the definition of the inner product comes from and everything else.

331
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:19,777
 Beautiful ¨C it¡¯s beautiful, all right. So the trick is in extending that from,

332
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:21,728
 if you like this sort of thing,

333
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:28,136
 the trick is extending that from vectors to functions and reasoning by analogy,

334
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,411
 all right. It¡¯s not, you know,

335
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:35,811
 now let me say what you should think about and what you shouldn¡¯t think about,

336
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:36,635
 the analogy is very strong.

337
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:42,018
 In many ways your geometric intuition for what happens for vectors you can draw carries over

338
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:46,677
 at least algebraically to this more general situation;

339
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:51,361
 however, so let me say one more thing then.

340
00:22:51,361 --> 00:23:02,173
 These complex exponentials are exactly functions or orthogonal functions of length one.

341
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:06,849
 That calculation that I¡¯ve just erased with complex exponentials says this,

342
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:14,731
 says either the 2 pi NT in a product with either 2 pi MT,

343
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:15,375
 all right,

344
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,167
 that¡¯s the integral of this times the conjugate of this.

345
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,175
 The conjugate of either the 2 p MT is either the minus 2 pi MT,

346
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:21,628
 that¡¯s where the minus sign comes from, all right.

347
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:28,964
 This is equal to zero if M is different from N and it¡¯s different to one if M is equal to N.

348
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:31,660
 All right, these are ortho-

349
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,089
normal vectors with respect to this inner product.

350
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,730
 They¡¯re orthogonal, their inner product is zero,

351
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,160
 when they¡¯re distinct, and they have Length One,

352
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,100
 their norm is equal to 1 when they¡¯re equal.

353
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,006
 Okay, now, as I said your reason by analogy,

354
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:50,798
 you can visualize what it means for vectors to be perpendicular.

355
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:56,717
 You can draw this picture, all right. So you might say to yourself,

356
00:23:56,717 --> 00:24:01,935
 I should be able to visualize this.

357
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:02,576
 I should be able to sit in a quite room,

358
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:07,290
 turn the lights off and visualize what it means for complex exponentials to be orthogonal.

359
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:12,443
 Yes, yes, I see it. No, you don¡¯t. Let me relieve you of this burden.

360
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:17,930
 There is no reason in hell that you should be able to visualize when two functions,

361
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,439
 let alone complex exponentials are orthogonal.

362
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:26,512
 Don¡¯t beat yourself up trying to do that and don¡¯t say to yourself you¡¯re less of a person 

363
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:30,392
if you cannot visualize when two functions are perpendicular,

364
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:33,625
 not only complex exponentials, but sines and cosines,

365
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,160
 all sort of innocent-

366
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,398
looking functions out there that you have worked with for all of your life turn out to have this sort of orthogonality relationship.

367
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,413
 But you might say to yourself, like sines and cosines,

368
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:48,370
 so sine FT if orthogonal to cosine FT or sine of 2 p T is orthogonal to cosine 2 p T.

369
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,031
 All sorts of interesting results like that,

370
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,663
 but you might say to yourself, ¡°Gee if I look at the graph,

371
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:54,316
 I should be able to visualize this.¡± Don¡¯t bother.

372
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:59,346
 All right, there¡¯s no point. There¡¯s no point.

373
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:01,323
 It¡¯s reasoning by analogy, all right.

374
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:03,526
 The fact is you establish thee formulas;

375
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:07,998
 you establish they¡¯re orthogonal and then you apply your intuition for orthogonal functions,

376
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:12,510
 for orthogonal vectors where you can visualize it to situations where you can¡¯t visualize it,

377
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,892
 all right and that¡¯s the real power of this line of reasoning,

378
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:22,978
 because you can apply your intuition to places where it should have no business applying somehow,

379
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:31,915
 all right. All right, now, almost, almost,

380
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:36,056
 almost, almost, almost, the final thing then,

381
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:45,067
 the final piece of this approach to Fourier series is to realize the Fourier coefficients 

382
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:49,832
are projections of the function on to these complex exponentials,

383
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:50,688
 all right. So again,

384
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:55,171
 I want to remind you of one of the ways you use inner product is to define projections,

385
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:57,015
 to define orthogonal projections in particular,

386
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:11,948
 so you use the inner product for vectors to define and compute projections.

387
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:17,827
 All right, if U and V are two vectors, univectors,

388
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,156
 say,

389
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:22,596
 norm of U equals 1 and norm of V equals 1,

390
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:28,033
 then what is the projection of V onto U,

391
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,905
 and the projection onto V onto U is just the inner product of V.

392
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:31,927
U. That¡¯s how much U knows V or V knows U,

393
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:33,935
 all right.

394
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:40,439
 The projection here is the inner product of V with U,

395
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,427
 okay.

396
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:45,697
 And how much does U know V is the inner product of U,

397
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,113
 same thing. All right,

398
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:51,453
 so the vector projection here is that¡¯s the length of the projection,

399
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:53,294
 all right,

400
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:59,149
 and then the vector that goes in the direction of U that has this length is this time,

401
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:05,234
 so the vector projection is inner product of V with U times U.

402
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,327
 All right, U is the univector,

403
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,523
 so you go in that direction this length and that¡¯s how you project,

404
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:14,202
 and it¡¯ shouldn¡¯t be shocking.

405
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:17,408
 It should be somewhere in your background to realize that you¡¯ve certainly had classes in linear algebra 

406
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:22,662
that decomposing a vector into its projections onto given vectors can be a very useful thing.

407
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:26,518
 It¡¯s breaking a vector down into its component parts,

408
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:29,588
 breaking a vector down into its component parts,

409
00:27:29,588 --> 00:27:35,654
 all right. Now, what is the situation for functions,

410
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,345
 it¡¯s exactly analogous.

411
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:41,869
 I don¡¯t want to say it¡¯s exactly the same because you can¡¯t draw the picture,

412
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,310
 but you can write down the formulas and the formulas are a good guide.

413
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:51,970
 The formulas are a good guide. What is the Fourier coefficient?

414
00:27:51,970 --> 00:28:02,801
 The Fourier coefficient is exactly a projection,

415
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,465
 all right.

416
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:08,902
 If I compute the inner product of the function F with the complex exponential,

417
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:10,969
 either the 2pi NT,

418
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:18,859
 then that¡¯s exactly the integral from zero to one of F of T times either the 2 pi NT bar DT.

419
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:25,789
 That is the integral from zero to one of F of T either the minus 2 pi NT DT,

420
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,257
 that is the nth Fourier coefficient.

421
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:41,123
 The nth Fourier coefficient is exactly the projection of the function onto the nth complex exponential.

422
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:48,049
 All right, cool. Way cool. Infinitely cool.

423
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:57,978
 So cool. And what is writing the Fourier series?

424
00:28:57,978 --> 00:29:00,579
 What is writing the Fourier series ¨C

425
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:08,673
 to write F of T is equal to the sum from K going to a minus infinity to infinity,

426
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:22,504
 [inaudible] either the 2 pi KT is to write F of T is the sum from K going to a minus infinity

427
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:31,625
 to infinity of the inner product of F with the K complex exponential times the complex K complex exponential.

428
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,651
 This is a number, all right, that¡¯s the Fourier coefficient.

429
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:38,702
 That ¡®s the length of the projection of F onto its K component,

430
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:41,405
 and there¡¯s the K component. All right, it¡¯s exactly what that is,

431
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,367
 and it¡¯s this point of view that is so ubiquitous,

432
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,304
 all right, so ubiquitous, not only in a Fourier series,

433
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:50,655
 but in other versions of essentially the same ideas.

434
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,171
 And you see this all the time in signal processing.

435
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,554
 I talk about wavelets time.

436
00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:58,843
 I mentioned wavelets just very briefly because wavelets is such a hot topic.

437
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:00,510
 It¡¯s the same sort of thing.

438
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,068
 You¡¯re trying to decompose the function into its simpler components and

439
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,010
 in this case the simpler components are either the 2 p or the complex exponentials,

440
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,752
 all right.

441
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:13,974
 So to write an expression like this down to be able to say this in the appropriate notions of convergents is to say ¨C

442
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:21,634
 I¡¯ll do it over here ¨C

443
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,755
 is to say that the complex exponentials form an ortho-

444
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,520
normal basis for the square integrable functions,

445
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,247
 all right.

446
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,426
 To be able to write this statement and understand 

447
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:41,125
what it means in terms of convergents and all the rest of that jazz is to say,

448
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:41,960
 is to say,

449
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:51,616
 that the complex exponentials that is all of these,

450
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,949
 even the 2 pi KT,

451
00:30:52,949 --> 00:31:06,366
 K going from minus infinity to infinity form an ortho-

452
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,968
normal basis for these periodic functions,

453
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:13,167
 squared integral periodic functions, all right.

454
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,584
 And then sometimes the game is to take different ortho-

455
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:16,303
normal basis. Wavelets are nothing but,

456
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,353
 I'm not going to say nothing but because they have their own fascination,

457
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:19,986
 they¡¯re another ortho-

458
00:31:19,986 --> 00:31:22,990
normal basis for square integrable functions.

459
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,603
 The complex exponentials are not the only ortho-

460
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:27,290
normal basis just like any vector space just doesn¡¯t¡¯ have,

461
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,881
 has lots of different orthogonal-normal basis.

462
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:30,552
 These are particularly useful ones.

463
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:36,434
 So to write this synthesis formula is to express F in terms of its components,

464
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:37,575
 what components,

465
00:31:37,575 --> 00:31:40,748
 the components in terms of these elementary building blocks,

466
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:43,172
 all right, and what are the coefficients,

467
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:44,540
 the coefficients, like they are for any ortho-

468
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,785
normal basis are the projection of the vector in those directions,

469
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:49,255
 all right.

470
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:52,703
 It¡¯s very satisfying and you should try to put this in your head,

471
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:56,742
 yeah. Student:

472
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:58,605
[Inaudible] in the sense that you can¡¯t get one from the other in the rotation [inaudible].

473
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:01,015
 Instructor (Brad Osgood):Well, it¡¯s more complicated,

474
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:07,652
 so the question is are the bases like in [inaudible] dimensional spaces the bases are related to each other

475
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:10,906
 by a essentially a rotation of unitary or orthogonal matrix and in space,

476
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:11,647
 yes,

477
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,550
 you have unitary transformations linear operators that are unitary,

478
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,827
 but the definitions are a little bit more complicated.

479
00:32:16,827 --> 00:32:18,693
 But you have similar sets of things. All right,

480
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,292
 you can get to ortho-normal basis to another ortho-

481
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:24,639
normal basis. Okay. All right, this is, like I say,

482
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,526
 so what one can say, of course, I would say much more about this.

483
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,921
 I don¡¯t want to. All right, well, I do want to,

484
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:32,096
 but I can¡¯t, all right. All right,

485
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:36,076
 it¡¯s this point of view that is important for you to carry forward,

486
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:37,131
 all right.

487
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:38,068
 That¡¯s all I'm saying because you will see it,

488
00:32:38,068 --> 00:32:42,149
 you will see it, all right. And again, the idea is you reason by analogy,

489
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:46,599
 all right. You gotta; it¡¯s hard to write down this formula,

490
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,404
 all right, that¡¯s something new. All right,

491
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:49,505
 writing down a formula,

492
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:52,002
 writing down an inner product in terms of an integral,

493
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:54,263
 all right, I gotta deal with that. That¡¯s something hard,

494
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,884
 and I can¡¯t visualize it, all right.

495
00:32:56,884 --> 00:33:00,250
 But the words you use in the case where you can visualize things 

496
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,968
are almost identical to the words you use in the situation where you can¡¯t visualize things.

497
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:05,523
 All right,

498
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:12,355
 and you can carry that intuition over from the one case to the other case and it¡¯s extremely important and I¡¯ll give you one,

499
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:15,399
 I keep saying one final thing. So this time for sure,

500
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,648
 an application of this is what¡¯s also called Railey¡¯s identity,

501
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:31,699
 which is nothing more than to say a length of a vector can be obtained in terms of some of the sum of the squares of its components,

502
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,085
 all right.

503
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,941
 You know how to find the length of a vector in [inaudible].

504
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:37,057
 You add up the sums of the components, right?

505
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:46,030
 You do the same thing here. Railey¡¯s identity,

506
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,401
 and I will not derive it for you,

507
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,389
 but it is derived in the book and I even say something like,

508
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:50,482
 ¡°Do not go to bed until you understand ¨C

509
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:53,296
 do not go to sleep until you understand every step in the derivation.

510
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:58,815
¡± It says the integral from 0 to 1 of F of T squared DT.

511
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:00,877
 You write it in terms of its Fourier coefficients ¨C

512
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:01,591
 I didn¡¯t write that down,

513
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:03,720
 is the sum of the squares of the Fourier coefficients.

514
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,455
 Okay,

515
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:10,098
 going from minus infinity to infinity of [inaudible] K squared,

516
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,778
 all right. That¡¯s Railey¡¯s identify.

517
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:18,215
 It says the length of a vector is the sum of the squares of its components,

518
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:18,704
 all right,

519
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:23,032
 the components of the function are its Fourier coefficients,

520
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:25,098
 all right. This is the length of a function;

521
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:28,043
 it is the inner product of the square length of a function.

522
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:30,191
 It¡¯s the inner product of a function with itself.

523
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:33,039
 It is the sum of the squares of its components.

524
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,093
 That¡¯s all this says.

525
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:40,566
 And it follows algebraically exactly in the same way as you would prove this using inner products for vectors,

526
00:34:40,566 --> 00:34:43,847
 exactly, exactly. All right, now,

527
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:47,504
 this was known before any of this stuff was put in place,

528
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:48,082
 all right,

529
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:51,503
 but when all this sort of general framework was put in place,

530
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:55,038
 this identity was known before the general framework or orthogonal functions,

531
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:57,547
 square integrable functions, all the rest of that jazz,

532
00:34:57,547 --> 00:34:59,595
 and it was viewed as an identity for energy,

533
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,073
 all right, this is the energy, the function and these are somehow,

534
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:05,201
 you know, the individual components here.

535
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,650
 And that¡¯s why one often says,

536
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,517
 you can compute the energy and the time domain or the frequency domain,

537
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:11,662
 we¡¯re gonna find an analogy for this before it transforms,

538
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:13,556
 all right.

539
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:15,069
 But it really says nothing other than the length of the vectors,

540
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,338
 the sum of the squares of the components.

541
00:35:16,338 --> 00:35:21,853
 How much ¨C so let me write down, here¡¯s F of T is the sum of,

542
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:29,158
 here¡¯s the Fourier series, [inaudible] either the 2 pi KT,

543
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,041
 all right. All right,

544
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:38,887
 how much energy does F have as a signal?

545
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,929
 It has this much. All right,

546
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,872
 how much energy does each one of its components have?

547
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:44,574
 Well,

548
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:50,504
 the energy of each one of the complex exponentials is one because they¡¯re of length one.

549
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:53,171
 So, how much energy,

550
00:35:53,171 --> 00:35:55,203
 how much square energy does each one of the components have?

551
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,457
 It¡¯s the magnitude of this thing squared;

552
00:35:57,457 --> 00:36:00,351
 it¡¯s the multiplier. It¡¯s the projection out front.

553
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:05,015
 [Inaudible] squared times the energy, which is 1 of the complex exponential,

554
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:06,463
 so what is the total energy here,

555
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:07,988
 what is the square of the total energy here?

556
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:12,019
 It¡¯s the sum of the squares or the contributions of that energy from individual components.

557
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:17,311
 Each individual component is contributing an amount [inaudible] of K to the whole sum,

558
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:25,659
 or the energy it contributes is the square of [Inaudible] of K absolute value squared to the whole sum,

559
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:26,846
 the whole number, okay, pretty cool; pretty cool.

560
00:36:26,846 --> 00:36:33,561
 All right, here ends the sermon.

561
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:41,681
 Don¡¯t leave without putting something into the collection plate.

562
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,501
 All right. All right,

563
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:48,720
 here ends the sermon on inner product square [inaudible] and so on,

564
00:36:48,720 --> 00:37:00,119
 okay? All I can say is trust me; you¡¯ll run into it again.

565
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,024
 Now,

566
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,556
 I want to do and I probably won¡¯t finish it today.

567
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,648
 I¡¯ll finish it up on Wednesday, although it goes pretty fast.

568
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:13,293
 I want to do a classic application of Fourier series to the study of the classic physical problem,

569
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,441
 in fact,

570
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,160
 the problem that launched the whole subject.

571
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:25,167
 Sop I want to do an application to heat flow.

572
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:30,132
 All right,

573
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:33,148
 this is a very important part of your intellectual heritage,

574
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:34,777
 all right. I'm serious.

575
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:38,139
 That is if you¡¯re going to be practicing scientists and engineers,

576
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:38,819
 you know,

577
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:42,256
 you want to know something about where the subject came from because again,

578
00:37:42,256 --> 00:37:45,190
 you know, you some how wind up re-

579
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,077
visiting a lot of these ideas in different context,

580
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:47,710
 but often in similar context.

581
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,517
 And this was the problem that really started it all.

582
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,913
 This was the problem in studying how heat,

583
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:55,740
 how the temperature varies in time,

584
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,458
 when there¡¯s some initial temperature distribution.

585
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,052
 All right,

586
00:37:58,052 --> 00:38:15,841
 so you have a region in space and with an initial temperature distribution and an initial distribution F of X of temperature.

587
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:18,898
 I say F of X here just to indicate that X is some sort of spatial variable,

588
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:21,384
 all right, so some region in space, you know,

589
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,494
 the dimension of X is the dimension of the region,

590
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:27,869
 all right.

591
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,246
 And the question is how does the temperature [inaudible],

592
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:30,457
 all right.

593
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:31,371
 You have an initial distribution of temperature,

594
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:34,489
 that¡¯s what happens at T equals zero, then as T increases,

595
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:35,706
 the temperature changes. All right,

596
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:40,038
 the heat flows from one part of the body to the other part of the body and you want to know how is that governed,

597
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:41,571
 all right.

598
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:51,636
 How does the temperature change both in position,

599
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:54,097
 I should say vary, well, change is fine ¨C

600
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:59,131
 how does the temperature change in position and time.

601
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,562
 All right, this was an important problem,

602
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:06,862
 still is an important problem actually and we¡¯re only gonna handle one very special case of it,

603
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:09,436
 the case of the original case that was handled by Fourier series,

604
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,619
 the problem with the Fourier study.

605
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:25,241
 Where periodicity comes into the problem naturally because of the periodicity in space.

606
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:27,377
 So to study this problem means to say first of all,

607
00:39:27,377 --> 00:39:32,970
 what the region is and then to say what the initial distribution of temperature is or at least say

608
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,568
 that there is given an initial distribution of temperature,

609
00:39:34,568 --> 00:39:47,215
 all right. So we look at a heated ring. Sound ¨C

610
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:51,579
 that sound. Okay. All right, something like this,

611
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:52,785
 all right. Given an initial temperature,

612
00:39:52,785 --> 00:40:04,274
 given an initial temperature say F of X,

613
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:09,019
 F of X ¨C X is a position on the circle; X is a point on the circle,

614
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:09,852
 okay?

615
00:40:09,852 --> 00:40:19,363
 And we let U of XT be the temperature at X at time T ¨C

616
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,534
 at position X at time T. All right,

617
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:24,085
 and the question is can we say something about it.

618
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:33,948
 That¡¯s the function we want to find. We want to study U of XT,

619
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:34,436
 all right. Now,

620
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:39,022
 the fact is periodicity enters into this problem,

621
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,874
 periodicity in space because the circle,

622
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:46,233
 the temperature here is the same as the temperature at the same place,

623
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:49,584
 if I increase it by 2 p if I'm going around a circle,

624
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:52,892
 then obviously the temperature is periodic as the position.

625
00:40:52,892 --> 00:41:09,536
 Okay,

626
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:19,611
 so the temperature is periodic as a function of X.

627
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,348
 All right,

628
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:22,324
 and let¡¯s normalize things so we assume the period is 1,

629
00:41:22,324 --> 00:41:23,860
 so the circle is radius or whatever it is,

630
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,465
 or another way of looking at it is just imagine the circle is the interval from 0 to 1 and I identify the end points,

631
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:29,871
 all right. So let¡¯s supposed we have ¨C

632
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:32,128
 just because we¡¯ve been dealing with functions of Period 1,

633
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:37,961
 let¡¯s suppose that. Let¡¯s supposed Period 1.

634
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,003
 Period 1, all right,

635
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:41,788
 so that is the function of the initial temperature distribution,

636
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:45,980
 F or X is periodic of Period 1 and so is UNX,

637
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,987
 not in T;

638
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:48,452
 it¡¯s not periodic as a function of time,

639
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:50,429
 but it¡¯s periodic as a function of the spatial variable.

640
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:57,659
 U of X plus 1 for any variable of T is the same thing as U of X at that value of T,

641
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:58,191
 okay?

642
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:01,104
 That¡¯s fundamental and that¡¯s how Fourier got into this;

643
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,057
 that¡¯s why he introduced those ideas.

644
00:42:02,057 --> 00:42:05,874
 You¡¯d consider this problem where there¡¯s periodicity in space.

645
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:11,440
 The symmetry of the object that you¡¯re heating up and that has consequences.

646
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,384
 All right, so now, with a certain amount of confidence,

647
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:31,028
 with a certain amount of bravado, we write down the Fourier series.

648
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,106
 So we write the Fourier series,

649
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:40,036
 U of XT is the sum from K going to minus infinity to infinity of C sub K,

650
00:42:40,036 --> 00:42:44,703
 I¡¯ll write it like this, C sub K either the 2 pi KX.

651
00:42:44,703 --> 00:42:46,750
 It¡¯s periodic in the spatial variable,

652
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,191
 so the variable in the complex exponential is X.

653
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:53,903
 Where is the time dependents? No,

654
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,172
 the time dependents is in the coefficient,

655
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:56,727
 C.

656
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:58,688
 That¡¯s where the time dependence has to be.

657
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:00,008
 K is just a constant; K is just an integer.

658
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:09,589
 The time dependence is in the cK.

659
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:15,585
 That is a better way and more accurate way of writing it is like so.

660
00:43:15,585 --> 00:43:35,245
 U of XT is the sum from K going from minus infinity to infinity of C sub K of T.

661
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,291
 I know what it is; it¡¯s the Fourier coefficient,

662
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:38,792
 I¡¯ll bring that in later, but let me just write in terms,

663
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:44,154
 let me just call it C right now. C sub K of T times E to the 2 pi KX,

664
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,842
 all right, periodic and X varying in T. How does it vary in T;

665
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:52,881
 that¡¯s what we want to know, all right. The mystery here are the coefficients.

666
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,537
 We could solve the problem if I could find the coefficients,

667
00:43:54,537 --> 00:43:55,813
 so in terms of the initial temperature distribution,

668
00:43:55,813 --> 00:44:03,571
 so what are the CK? That¡¯s the question.

669
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:06,306
 All right, now,

670
00:44:06,306 --> 00:44:09,699
 we¡¯re gonna be able to attack this problem because independent of periodicity,

671
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,474
 independent of anything else,

672
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,727
 heat flow is governed by a partial differential equation.

673
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:14,536
 All right,

674
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:17,117
 the flow of heat on a circle or another regions ¨C

675
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:19,008
 all right, this is in itself a big subject,

676
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:20,734
 but it¡¯s one of the basic equations,

677
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:23,402
 partial differential equations of mathematical physics,

678
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:26,762
 which you have probably seen somewhere in your life and again,

679
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:32,988
 you will see again, heat flow ¨C I¡¯ll just do it in one dimension,

680
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:35,535
 all right. I'm talking about one-dimensional problems here,

681
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:38,878
 but there are also ways of analyzing this for flow over a two-

682
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,453
dimensional or a three-dimensional region.

683
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:46,453
 We have the heat equation,

684
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:50,651
 which says that the time derivative of the temperature is proportional and 

685
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:53,120
somehow maybe I should call it another constant because I¡¯ve already used K,

686
00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:00,713
 A times the second X derivative, all right.

687
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:07,725
 That¡¯s the one-dimensional heal equation.

688
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:08,853
 All right, I'm not gonna derive that.

689
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:13,033
 Actually I have a derivation of that in the book that sort of follows Bracewell¡¯s discussion of the heat equation,

690
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:16,843
 but it¡¯s a fundamental equation of mathematical physics.

691
00:45:16,843 --> 00:45:20,720
 The constant A here depends on the physical because this is one of these great dodges of all time.

692
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,521
 The constant A depends on the physical characteristics of the region which no one wants to talk much about,

693
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:31,192
 but that affects the size of A, all right.

694
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:33,017
 I should say more generally,

695
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:37,063
 this equation governs not just the flow of heat,

696
00:45:37,063 --> 00:45:37,675
 but it¡¯s in general is called the diffusion equation.

697
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:41,687
 It governs how things diffuse. Things ¨C what things,

698
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:44,893
 like charge through a wire is studied by this equation,

699
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:47,843
 holes through a semi conductor are governed by an equation,

700
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:50,433
 a higher dimensional version of the equation but the same idea,

701
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:52,207
 all right, so this is general governs,

702
00:45:52,207 --> 00:46:00,862
 this is also called the diffusion equation and it governs phenomenon that are associated with diffusion.

703
00:46:00,862 --> 00:46:02,155
 It¡¯s a general term,

704
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:05,702
 but it¡¯s a term you¡¯ll probably run across.

705
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:07,913
 All right, now I want to choose; I'm not gonna get too far today,

706
00:46:07,913 --> 00:46:10,353
 but I'm gonna get a little along the way,

707
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,257
 so I wanna choose ¨C

708
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:15,311
 I want to apply this equation to study this function.

709
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:26,213
 All right, I'm gonna use this for the ring.

710
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:32,306
 All right, and just to simplify my calculation,

711
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:35,110
 although it does not make any substantive difference,

712
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:38,330
 I'm gonna choose the constants so that A is equal to .

713
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,462
. That¡¯s a standard choice,

714
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:41,774
 certainly for the mathematical analysis,

715
00:46:41,774 --> 00:46:43,927
 but it doesn¡¯t matter.

716
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:48,802
 You could have the constant tagging along in the whole thing and it wouldn¡¯t¡¯ affect the analysis.

717
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:52,680
 So I'm gonna choose A equals . or choose constants of A equals .

718
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,196
.

719
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:55,477
 So the equation looks like use of T is equal to .

720
00:46:55,477 --> 00:47:03,195
 use of XX, all right. Now, I'm gonna short-

721
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,480
cut the discussion a little bit.

722
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,293
 There¡¯s one way of doing it in the book,

723
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:07,298
 in the notes,

724
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:14,539
 which is a little bit more rigorous than what I'm gonna do although both can be justified very easily.

725
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:15,250
 I'm going to plug that equation, that formula for ¨C

726
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,355
 we have a formula for U in some sense, not in some sense,

727
00:47:17,355 --> 00:47:20,714
 we have a formula for U in this sense.

728
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:23,374
 And I'm gonna plug this into the equation.

729
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:34,171
 Plug U of XT is sum over K, CK of T, either the 2 pi KX into the equation,

730
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:38,799
 into the use of T is equal to . UXX. What happens?

731
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:54,705
 What happens? Well, so use of T, if I differentiate with respect,

732
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,197
 I'm sorry; I should have said this, but I assumed everybody knew,

733
00:47:58,197 --> 00:48:00,263
 use of T is a partial [inaudible] with respect of T,

734
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:01,650
 or that function over there, so what is that?

735
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,092
 Well,

736
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:07,482
 the only thing that depends on T here is the coefficients,

737
00:48:07,482 --> 00:48:10,049
 C sub K. So that is sum over K,

738
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:11,888
 CK prime of T times the complex exponential.

739
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:19,161
 That stays alone -- 2 pi KX. What is UXX of this expression?

740
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:19,852
 Well,

741
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:23,872
 here I¡¯ve put the derivatives on the complex exponential and I differentiate twice,

742
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:26,469
 differentiating complex exponential is like differentiating an ordinary exponential.

743
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:30,708
 The constant here comes down if I differentiate,

744
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,094
 so I get CK of T,

745
00:48:32,094 --> 00:48:39,562
 that¡¯s left alone because I'm differentiating with respect to X and then if I differentiate the 2 pi KX twice,

746
00:48:39,562 --> 00:48:41,500
 with respect to X,

747
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:49,346
 I get 2 pi K squared times either the 2 pi KX.

748
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:53,468
 Nothing up my sleeve, no tricks, no deceptions.

749
00:48:53,468 --> 00:49:01,694
 Okay, that¡¯s one more step,

750
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:08,764
 that¡¯s the sum over K T sub K of T times minus 4 p K squared 

751
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:14,284
because I squared is minus 1 times a complex exponential either the 2 pi KX.

752
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:18,607
 All right, not quite the two. Then we gotta go ¨C

753
00:49:18,607 --> 00:49:27,772
 damn. Equate the two sides, use the heat equation.

754
00:49:27,772 --> 00:49:36,755
 Plug into the heat equation.

755
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:37,458
 So I get sum plug into UTs is equal to .

756
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,619
 UXX,

757
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:41,391
 and then I get sum over K CK prime of T,

758
00:49:41,391 --> 00:49:45,540
 either the 2 pi KX is equal . times that thing,

759
00:49:45,540 --> 00:50:00,587
 so it¡¯s gonna be sum over K minus 2 p squared K squared times C 2 p squared K squared times CK of T,

760
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:04,215
 times the complex exponential, either the 2 pi KX.

761
00:50:04,215 --> 00:50:11,344
 Not hard, that¡¯s not a hard step. Okay, all right,

762
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:21,468
 how would we do? Equate like terms; equate the coefficients.

763
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:27,554
 If I equate the coefficients, something great happens.

764
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:32,117
 [Inaudible] consequences I¡¯ll do next time.

765
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:34,475
 If I equate the coefficients,

766
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:37,526
 I¡¯ll get CK prime of T is equal to the coefficient,

767
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:39,057
 when I say equate the coefficients,

768
00:50:39,057 --> 00:50:40,502
 I mean the coefficients of the complex exponential.

769
00:50:40,502 --> 00:50:42,377
 CK prime into the 2 p KX,

770
00:50:42,377 --> 00:50:43,987
 what¡¯s the corresponding coefficient over here.

771
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:48,667
 It¡¯s this is equal to minus 2 pi squared K squared,

772
00:50:48,667 --> 00:51:01,107
 CK of T. But my friends, you know, that is a simple equation.

773
00:51:01,107 --> 00:51:10,248
 That is an ordinary differential equation for CK.

774
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:16,322
 I can solve this other problem. I get CK of T is the CK of 0,

775
00:51:16,322 --> 00:51:20,934
 the initial condition times [inaudible] minus 2 p squared,

776
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:32,747
 K squared T. Blow me down, all right. I¡¯ve found my coefficients ¨C

777
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:37,809
 pretty cool. All right, extremely cool. Very cool.

778
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:46,031
 And next time what I haven¡¯t done is I haven¡¯t brought back in the initial distribution of temperature 

779
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:53,477
and I want to manipulate this solution a little bit more and something absolutely magical happens.

780
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:53,477
 Wait for it on Wednesday. Okay. [End of Audio] Duration:
