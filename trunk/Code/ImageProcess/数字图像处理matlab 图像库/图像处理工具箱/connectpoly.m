function c = connectpoly(x, y)
%CONNECTPOLY Connects vertices of a polygon.
%   C = CONNECTPOLY(X, Y) connects the points with coordinates given
%   in X and Y with straight lines. These points are assumed to be a
%   sequence of polygon vertices organized in the clockwise or
%   counterclockwise direction. The output, C, is the set of points
%   along the boundary of the polygon in the form of an nr-by-2
%   coordinate sequence in the same direction as the input. The last
%   point in the sequence is equal to the first.
