function I = colorseg(varargin)
%COLORSEG Performs segmentation of a color image.
%   S = COLORSEG('EUCLIDEAN', F, T, M) performs segmentation of color
%   image F using a Euclidean measure of similarity. M is a 1-by-3
%   vector representing the average color used for segmentation (this
%   is the center of the sphere in Fig. 6.26 of DIPUM). T is the
%   threshold against which the distances are compared.
%
%   S = COLORSEG('MAHALANOBIS', F, T, M, C) performs segmentation of
%   color image F using the Mahalanobis distance as a measure of
%   similarity. C is the 3-by-3 covariance matrix of the sample color
%   vectors of the class of interest. See function covmatrix for the
%   computation of C and M. 
%
%   S is the segmented image (a binary matrix) in which 0s denote the
%   background.
