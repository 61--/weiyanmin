function lines = houghlines(f,theta,rho,rr,cc,fillgap,minlength)
%HOUGHLINES Extract line segments based on the Hough transform.
%   LINES = HOUGHLINES(F, THETA, RHO, RR, CC, FILLGAP, MINLENGTH)
%   extracts line segments in the image F associated with particular
%   bins in a Hough transform.  THETA and RHO are vectors returned by
%   function HOUGH.  Vectors RR and CC specify the rows and columns
%   of the Hough transform bins to use in searching for line
%   segments.  If HOUGHLINES finds two line segments associated with
%   the same Hough transform bin that are separated by less than
%   FILLGAP pixels, HOUGHLINES merges them into a single line
%   segment.  FILLGAP defaults to 20 if omitted.  Merged line
%   segments less than MINLENGTH pixels long are discarded.
%   MINLENGTH defaults to 40 if omitted. 
%
%   LINES is a structure array whose length equals the number of
%   merged line segments found.  Each element of the structure array
%   has these fields: 
%
%      point1    End-point of the line segment; two-element vector
%      point2    End-point of the line segment; two-element vector
%      length    Distance between point1 and point2
%      theta     Angle (in degrees) of the Hough transform bin
%      rho       Rho-axis position of the Hough transform bin
