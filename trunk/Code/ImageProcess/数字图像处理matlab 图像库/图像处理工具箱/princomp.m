function P = princomp(X, q)
%PRINCOMP Obtain principal-component vectors and related quantities.
%   P = PRINCOMP(X, Q) Computes the principal-component vectors of
%   the vector population contained in the rows of X, a matrix of
%   size K-by-n where K is the number of vectors and n is their
%   dimensionality. Q, with values in the range [0, n], is the number
%   of eigenvectors used in constructing the principal-components
%   transformation matrix. P is a structure with the following
%   fields:
%
%     P.Y      K-by-Q matrix whose columns are the principal-
%              component vectors.
%     P.A      Q-by-n principal components transformation matrix
%              whose rows are the Q eigenvectors of Cx corresponding
%              to the Q largest eigenvalues. 
%     P.X      K-by-n matrix whose rows are the vectors reconstructed
%              from the principal-component vectors. P.X and P.Y are
%              identical if Q = n. 
%     P.ems    The mean square error incurred in using only the Q
%              eigenvectors corresponding to the largest
%              eigenvalues. P.ems is 0 if Q = n.  
%     P.Cx     The n-by-n covariance matrix of the population in X.
%     P.mx     The n-by-1 mean vector of the population in X.
%     P.Cy     The Q-by-Q covariance matrix of the population in
%              Y. The main diagonal contains the eigenvalues (in
%              descending order) corresponding to the Q eigenvectors.
