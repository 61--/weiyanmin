README file for the DIPUM Toolbox.

These MATLAB functions were created for the book Digital Image
Processing Using MATLAB (DIPUM), by R.C. Gonzalez, R.E. Woods, and
S.L. Eddins, Prentice Hall, 2004, ISBN 0130085197.  The functions
supplement and extend the image processing functionality of MATLAB
and the Image Processing Toolbox, both offered by The MathWorks.

The free version of the DIPUM Toolbox
-------------------------------------
The free version of the DIPUM Toolbox contains only executable
MATLAB P-files.  P-files may be executed as MATLAB functions just
as M-files.  Unlike M-files, however, neither the help text nor the
source code is accessible.  Complete source code listings for all
functions are included in the book.

The registered version of the DIPUM Toolbox
-------------------------------------------
The registered version of the DIPUM Toolbox contains M-files with
readable source code and help text.  Users who want the M-files in
electronic form may obtain, for a small fee, a password allowing them
to download the registered toolbox.  More information about obtaining
the registered toolbox version is available at the book's web site:

http://www.imageprocessingbook.com/index_dipum.htm

Requirements
------------
This initial release of the DIPUM Toolbox was developed and tested
using MATLAB 6.5 and the Image Processing Toolbox 3.1.  The DIPUM
Toolbox is not supported for use with earlier versions of MATLAB or
the Image Processing Toolbox.  Most DIPUM functions require the
Image Processing Toolbox.   

The DIPUM Toolbox works with all MATLAB platforms.  It includes one
MEX-file (UNRAVEL, which is used for Huffman decoding).  Compiled
binaries for this MEX-file are provided for all MATLAB platforms.

Installation
------------
To install the DIPUM Toolbox, place the folder containing the
functions on a local hard drive or a network drive accessible to
your computer, and then include the folder location in the MATLAB
path.  To set the MATLAB path, start MATLAB and then select the
File/Set Path menu item.  Then select Add Folder.  Use the
navigation window to select the folder containing the functions.
Click OK and then click Save.  The functions will then be ready for
use within MATLAB.

Copyright
---------
The DIPUM Toolbox is protected under U.S. and international copyright
law.  You may not transfer, publish, disclose, display, or otherwise
make available either the free or the registered versions of the DIPUM
Toolbox to other people. In particular, you may not place either
version of the DIPUM Toolbox on an Internet site, a computer bulletin
board, or an anonymous ftp directory from which it could be downloaded
or copied by other people.  Anyone may obtain the free version
directly from the book's web site.
