function [st, angle, x0, y0] = signature(b, varargin)
%SIGNATURE Computes the signature of a boundary. 
%   [ST, ANGLE, X0, Y0] = SIGNATURE(B) computes the signature of a
%   given boundary, B, where B is an np-by-2 array (np > 2)
%   containing the (x, y) coordinates of the boundary ordered in a
%   clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The amplitude of the
%   signature as a function of increasing ANGLE is output in
%   ST. (X0,Y0) are the coordinates of the centroid of the
%   boundary. The maximum size of arrays ST and ANGLE is 360-by-1,
%   indicating a maximum resolution of one degree. The input must be
%   a one-pixel-thick boundary obtained, for example, by using the
%   function boundaries. By definition, a boundary is a closed
%   curve. 
% 
%   [ST, ANGLE, X0, Y0] = SIGNATURE(B) computes the signature, using
%   the centroid as the origin of the signature vector. 
%   
%   [ST, ANGLE, X0, Y0] = SIGNATURE(B, X0, Y0) computes the boundary
%   using the specified (X0, Y0) as the origin of the signature
%   vector.
