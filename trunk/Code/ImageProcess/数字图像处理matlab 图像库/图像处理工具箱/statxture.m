function t = statxture(f, scale)
%STATXTURE Computes statistical measures of texture in an image.
%   T = STATXURE(F, SCALE) computes six measures of texture from an
%   image (region) F. Parameter SCALE is a 6-dim row vector whose
%   elements multiply the 6 corresponding elements of T for scaling
%   purposes. If SCALE is not provided it defaults to all 1s.  The
%   output T is 6-by-1 vector with the following elements:
%     T(1) = Average gray level
%     T(2) = Average contrast
%     T(3) = Measure of smoothness
%     T(4) = Third moment
%     T(5) = Measure of uniformity
%     T(6) = Entropy
