function d = mahalanobis(varargin)
%MAHALANOBIS Computes the Mahalanobis distance.
%   D = MAHALANOBIS(Y, X) computes the Mahalanobis distance between
%   each vector in Y to the mean (centroid) of the vectors in X, and
%   outputs the result in vector D, whose length is size(Y, 1).  The
%   vectors in X and Y are assumed to be organized as rows.  The
%   input data can be real of complex. The outputs are real
%   quantities.

%   D = MAHALANOBIS(Y, CX, MX) computes the Mahalanobis distance
%   between each vector in Y and the given mean vector, MX. The
%   results are output in vector D, whose length is size(Y, 1).  The
%   vectors in Y are assumed to be organized as the rows of this
%   array. The input data can be real or complex. The outputs are
%   real quantities. In addition to the mean vector MX, the
%   covariance matrix CX of a population of vectors X also must be
%   provided. Use function COVMATRIX (Section 11.5) to compute MX and
%   CX.
