%BOUND2EIGHT Convert 4-connected boundary to 8-connected boundary.
%   RC_NEW = BOUND2EIGHT(RC) converts a four-connected boundary to an
%   eight-connected boundary.  RC is a P-by-2 matrix, each row of
%   which contains the row and column coordinates of a boundary
%   pixel.  RC must be a closed boundary; in other words, the last
%   row of RC must equal the first row of RC.  BOUND2EIGHT removes
%   boundary pixels that are necessary for four-connectedness but not
%   necessary for eight-connectedness.  RC_NEW is a Q-by-2 matrix,
%   where Q <= P.

% the remaining four-connected turns where the row is even and the
