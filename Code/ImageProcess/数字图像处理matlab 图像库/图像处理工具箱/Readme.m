% README file for the DIPUM Toolbox.
%
% These MATLAB functions were created for the book Digital Image
% Processing Using MATLAB (DIPUM), by R.C. Gonzalez, R.E. Woods, and
% S.L. Eddins, Prentice Hall, 2004, ISBN 0130085197.  The functions
% supplement and extend the image processing functionality of MATLAB
% and the Image Processing Toolbox, both offered by The MathWorks.
%
% The free version of the DIPUM Toolbox
% -------------------------------------
% The free version of the DIPUM Toolbox contains only executable
% MATLAB P-files.  P-files may be executed as MATLAB functions just
% as M-files.  Unlike M-files, however, neither the help text nor the
% source code is accessible.  Complete source code listings for all
% functions are included in the book.
%
% The registered version of the DIPUM Toolbox
% -------------------------------------------
% The registered version of the DIPUM Toolbox contains M-files with
% readable source code and help text.  Users who want the M-files in
% electronic form may obtain, for a small fee, a password allowing them
% to download the registered toolbox.  More information about obtaining
% the registered toolbox version is available at the book's web site:
%
%     http://www.imageprocessingbook.com/index_dipum.htm
%
% Requirements
% ------------
% This initial release of the DIPUM Toolbox was developed and tested
% using MATLAB 6.5 and the Image Processing Toolbox 3.1.  The DIPUM
% Toolbox is not supported for use with earlier versions of MATLAB or
% the Image Processing Toolbox.  Most DIPUM functions require the
% Image Processing Toolbox.   
%
% The DIPUM Toolbox works with all MATLAB platforms.  It includes one
% MEX-file (UNRAVEL, which is used for Huffman decoding).  Compiled
% binaries for this MEX-file are provided for all MATLAB platforms.
%
% Installation
% ------------
% To install the DIPUM Toolbox, place the folder containing the
% functions on a local hard drive or a network drive accessible to
% your computer, and then include the folder location in the MATLAB
% path.  To set the MATLAB path, start MATLAB and then select the
% File/Set Path menu item.  Then select Add Folder.  Use the
% navigation window to select the folder containing the functions.
% Click OK and then click Save.  The functions will then be ready for
% use within MATLAB.
%
% Copyright
% ---------
% The DIPUM Toolbox is protected under U.S. and international copyright
% law.  You may not transfer, publish, disclose, display, or otherwise
% make available either the free or the registered versions of the DIPUM
% Toolbox to other people. In particular, you may not place either
% version of the DIPUM Toolbox on an Internet site, a computer bulletin
% board, or an anonymous ftp directory from which it could be downloaded
% or copied by other people.  Anyone may obtain the free version
% directly from the book's web site.
